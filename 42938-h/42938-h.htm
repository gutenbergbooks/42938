AMATEUR HORSE-TRAINING.</h2>

<p>“My <i>dear</i>,” said my wife, “you don’t mean to say
you have <i>bought that</i> horse?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, indeed,” replied I; “and very cheap, too.
And why not?”</p>

<p>“You will never get your money back,” said she,
“no matter how cheap you have bought him. Don’t
keep him. Send him back before it is too late.”</p>

<p>It was a sultry July morning, and my wife stood on
the farm-house porch, in provokingly fresh attire, while
I held my new acquisition by the bridle in the scorching
sun; and just recovering as I was from illness, this
conversation struck me as really anything but <i>tonic</i> in
its character. However, bracing myself up, I replied,
“But I don’t want to get my money back; I intend to
train him for my own use under the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can never do anything with that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
horse. Why, he is the awkwardest brute I ever saw.
Just look at him now!”</p>

<p>In fact, his appearance was anything but beautiful
at that moment. His Roman nose, carried a long way
forward and a little on one side, gave him somewhat
the air of a camel; his coat showed no recent acquaintance
with the brush; and as he stood there sleepily in
the sun, with one hind-leg hitched up, he did not present
at all a picture to charm a lady’s eye. Nevertheless,
he was, in fact, a reasonably well-made horse, a full
black, fifteen and three-quarter hands high, sound, kind,
and seven years old.</p>

<p>“He’s just horrid,” said my wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” said I; “that’s only a bad habit
he has. We will soon cure him of such slovenly tricks.
Just see what good points he has. His legs are a little
long, to be sure, but they are broad, and have excellent
hoofs; his breast is narrow, but then it is deep; and
that large nostril was not given him for nothing. You
will see he will run like a race-horse.”</p>

<p>“If you once get him started you can never stop
him,” said my wife. “You know how he pulls, and
how nervous he is. He will go till he drops. You
are not strong enough to ride such a horse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense,” said I; “you can see that there is
no mischief in him. Look what a kind eye he has!
The fact is, horses are often very sensitive; and while
this one may never have been cruelly treated, yet he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
has been misunderstood, and his feelings hurt a great
many times a day. Human beings are the only things
he seems afraid of. As for his awkward carriage, it is
no worse than that of the farm hand who has made
such a failure of trying to use him, and who is, nevertheless,
when he stands up straight, a well-made, good-looking
fellow. A little careful handling will make
that animal as different from his present self as a dandified
English sergeant is from the raw recruit he once
was. What do you think of his name? It is Sambo.”</p>

<p>But my wife was not to be led off on any side question,
and after intimating that such a plebeian appellation
struck her as quite suitable, she continued; “Now
you know that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;” (the farmer of whom I purchased)
“knows a great deal more about horses than
you do; you must admit that, for he has been buying
and selling and driving them all his life, and <i>he</i> doesn’t
like him, or he wouldn’t sell so cheap; and as for
training him, for my part I don’t believe horse-training
can be learned out of books, as a woman would learn a
receipt for making cake. Do get him to take the horse
back!”</p>

<p>Now I have a great respect for my wife’s opinion in
general, and in this particular case all her points seemed
well taken.</p>

<p>The horse was tall, and I was short; he was excitable,
and I hadn’t the strength of a boy; he was very awkward,
and I had never trained a horse in my life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
However, I had been reading up a little on the subject,
and feeling the confidence in myself which a very little
knowledge is apt to impart, I was determined to try
my hand.</p>

<p>I had remarked that there was a certain French system
which was, in the several works I had consulted,
always spoken of with respect as a complete and original
method, so I obtained a copy of the book, in which
is set forth the <i>Méthode d’Équitation basée sur de
nouveaux Principes, par F. Baucher</i>, and having disentangled
(no easy task) what was really practical from
the enveloping mass of conceited sham scientific nonsense,
I had numbered the margin so as to make a series
of simple progressive lessons of half an hour each.
The volume in question, which was not, by-the-bye, the
present improved edition, I now produced in a somewhat
dog-eared condition from under my arm. My
wife, seeing that remonstrance was of no avail, took a
seat on the veranda, so as to be ready to advise and
assist, while my excellent friends, the farmer and his
wife, came out “to see the circus,” as they said, and
established themselves in suitable midsummer attitudes,
with countenances of amused expectation.</p>

<p>“The first few lessons must be given on foot,” said
I, and spreading my Baucher open upon the “horse-block,”
I proceeded to carry out its first injunction by
placing myself, with riding-whip under my arm, in
front of the horse, which was already saddled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
bridled, and “looking him kindly in the face.” He
bore my gaze with equanimity, but when the riding-whip
was produced he started violently; and when I
raised my hand to pat his neck reassuringly he threw
up his head and ran back. This evidently was not
temper, but alarm. Clearly, moral suasion was not the
kind that had been used with him hitherto. In plain
English, he had been beaten on the head; and it was
some time before he got over the impression made by
such ill-treatment and ceased dodging at every sudden
motion on my part.</p>

<p>However, a lump of sugar gave the poor fellow more
confidence, and, avoiding all brusque movements, I went
on to give him the first lesson of the Baucher series,
viz., <i>To Come to the Whip</i>.</p>

<p>It is encouraging for beginners that this lesson, while
producing conspicuous results, is in most cases very
easy. In less than half an hour my audience was not
a little surprised to see Sambo come to me at the slightest
motion of the whip, and follow me about with neck
arched, ears pricked up, and eyes lustrous with the
unwonted pleasure of comprehending and voluntarily

</div>

<p>“Well, that’s very pretty,” said the farmer; “but
what’s the good of it?”</p>

<p>This criticism, it may be remarked, he continued to
repeat at every step in the horse’s education. He did
not “see the good” of a double bridle with two bits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
He did not see the good of teaching the horse to relax
the muscles of his jaw and to hold the bit lightly in the
mouth. He did not see the good of suppling the various
muscles of the neck, on which, nevertheless, depend
to a surprising degree the balance of the whole body
and the easy motion of the limbs. In fact, he maintained
his attitude of amused and good-natured incredulity
until one day, after about three weeks, I rode
Sambo into the lawn, his neck arched and tail displayed,
and, with the reins hanging on my little finger, made
him cut circles and figure eights of all sizes at a spanking
trot.</p>

<p>Then my good farmer gave up, and said he really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
would hardly have believed it could be the same horse.
What is more, he took off his own driving horses “the
overdrawn check-reins” by which he had been hauling
their noses up into as near a horizontal line as possible,
and allowed them to carry their heads in a more natural
manner.</p>

<p>The afternoon of his first lesson Sambo was put in
double harness for a drive of ten or twelve miles, during
which he annoyed me excessively by his restless dancing
and fretting, so that next morning I expected to have
to begin all over again; but, to my satisfaction, he had
forgotten nothing, and came towards me at the first motion
of the whip, so that I passed on to the <i>Flexions de
la Mâchoire</i>, which we translate as the <i>suppling of the
muscles of the jaw</i>. Here I came upon my first difficulty,
and it lasted me several days. It was, however,
the only serious one in my whole course, and from subsequent
experience I am satisfied that my own awkwardness
and disposition to compel obedience by main
force were the principal causes of it.</p>

<p>However, success soon rewarded my perseverance,
and I had the satisfaction of feeling the iron grip of
the bit relax, and seeing the nose brought in and the
face assume a perpendicular position.</p>

<p>Without at present going further into detail, I will
simply say that at the expiration of a month, during
which Sambo had been driven double almost daily, his
education for the saddle had so far advanced that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
head was admirably carried, his trot was greatly improved&mdash;his
walk always had been light and swift&mdash;he
could trot sideways to the right or left, could pirouette
to the right or to the left on the hind-feet or on the
fore-feet, responding to the pressure of the rein upon
his neck or of the leg against his side, while he had become
so steady that I could fire at a mark with a pistol
from his back.</p>

<p>All this was very satisfactory progress, especially in
view of my total inexperience, poor health, and the heat
of the weather; but there is no doubt that any active
young girl of sixteen or eighteen can do the like, for it
was accomplished not by any mysterious or difficult process,
nor by any exertion of physical strength, but by patiently
following out, step by step, the processes which
I am about to describe, and which are substantially those
of Baucher, adapted to the use of a person of total inexperience,
and that person a lady.</p>

<p>If any such, having accompanied me thus far, feels
the impulse to try to improve her own mount, I will
confide to her the fact that the incidents narrated really
occurred within the last few years not a hundred miles
from New York; and I hope that the following propositions,
which are literally true, will help to encourage
her to an undertaking in which she will find amusement,
exercise, and a discipline as useful to herself as to
her horse:</p>

<p>1. If, as is very likely, you feel a little afraid of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
horse, you may be assured that your horse is a great
deal more afraid of you.</p>

<p>2. If you can only make clear to him what you wish
him to do, he will try his best to do it, and will feel
amply repaid for his efforts by a few kind words and
caresses.</p>

<p>3. His narrow brain can entertain only one idea at
once, and therefore only one problem, and that a simple
one, must be given him at a time.</p>

<p>4. Once the problem is mastered, a very little practice
makes the performance of the task instinctive, so that it
will be performed at the proper signal, even against his
own will, provided his mind is occupied with something
else.</p>

<p>This course of lessons is prepared with these facts in
view.</p>

<p>“But is horse-breaking a fitting amusement for young
ladies?” a mother asks, and with an air indicating that
to her, at least, a reply seems quite unnecessary. My
dear madam, it is not horse-breaking we are talking
of, but horse-training, which is a very different thing.
There are, doubtless, many women who could break a
colt if they chose, but it is an undertaking which we
certainly do not recommend. In the “breaking to harness”
of an untamed horse there is naturally included
more or less of training, but the essential lesson to be
taught is that it is useless to resist the will of man, for
sooner or later the horse will test the question, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
forth every effort to throw off control. When, however,
panting and exhausted, he finally submits, he has learned
the necessary lesson; and whether it be after a long
fight with a brutal rough-rider, or a physically painless
struggle with an adroit Rarey, he has learned it for life.
Henceforth he accepts the supremacy of the human
race, and, unless under the goad of maddening pain or
terror, will never, save in rare instances, really rebel;
obeying not men only, but women, children, and even
the very tools and implements of man, so that a dog
may lead him by the bridle. Like a spoiled child, however,
a horse will sometimes presume upon indulgence,
and, to use a mother’s phrase, will try to see how far he
can go.</p>

<p>At such times he is best opposed not by violence,
but by firmness, reinforced, perhaps, now and then by a
sharp cut with the whip, which, given unexpectedly at
the precise moment of disobedience, will have the settling
effect ascribed to the time-honored nursery “spank,”
and will bring him to his senses. Generally, however,
what seems insubordination is in reality nervousness,
which requires soothing, not punishment, and which
you will be careful not to increase by fidgeting or by
brusque movements of the reins. Even when severity
is needed, a reproof in a cold, stern tone is often more
effective than the lash.</p>

<p>Thousands of young girls, who for various reasons
cannot ride in winter, have every summer within reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
horses quite as good as the average of those at city riding-schools,
but which they are never allowed to mount.</p>

<p>They look wistfully at the honest animals, longing
for the exercise which would be so beneficial to their
health and to their physical development, while so delightfully
exhilarating to their spirits; but one horse is
pronounced “skittish,” another “hard-mouthed,” and so
on to the end. Nevertheless, some enterprising damsel
manages to overcome all opposition, and, skirted, hatted,
gloved, sets off in fine spirits. The horse, accustomed
to the resistance of a heavy vehicle, moves forward with
slow and heavy strides. Urged to greater speed, he rolls
his shoulders so that it is almost impossible to rise to his
trot. When put to the canter he pounds along the road,
his hind-feet kept far in the rear and his head swaying
up and down, while, missing the customary support of
the bearing-rein, he all the time leans his heavy head
on his rider’s delicate arm, till it seems as if she would
be pulled out of the saddle. However, the fresh open
air is there, and the scenery; exercise, too, in plenty,
and the pleasure of independent movement, so that our
heroine is half inclined to persevere. But, alas! an
equestrian party on well-bitted, light-stepping horses
sweeps by, casting a pitying glance at her rustic mount
and helpless plight. Mortified and discouraged, she goes
home and dismounts, determined not to try again. Nevertheless,
her horse is very likely quite as good as theirs,
and all he wants is a little “handling,” as the horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
say. For twenty-five dollars a riding-master will turn
him over to her as docile and supple as any of them,
and, with a little time and trouble, she can do it herself
for nothing.</p>

<p>As for the proficiency in riding requisite, it is only
necessary that you should not depend upon the reins for
your balance&mdash;a common habit, but one destructive of
all delicacy of the horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>As the first half-dozen lessons of this course are to be
given on foot, a riding-habit would only be in the way;
so go to your first <i>tête-à-tête</i> with your new scholar in a
stout walking-dress, easy in the waist, short of skirt, and
of stuff that will bear scouring, for frothy lips will certainly
be wiped on it. Let the hat be trim, the gloves
strong and old, and the boots heavy with low heels.</p>

<p>The saddle should, if possible, be of the safe and easy
modern pattern, with hunting-horn and low pommel on
the right side&mdash;but of course any one which does not
gall the horse can be made to do. It should have at
least two strong girths, and must be so padded with wool
as not to touch the backbone. Make sure, before putting
it on, that there are no tacks loose or likely to become
so in the lining.</p>

<p class="caption">A GOOD SADDLE.</p>
</div>

<p>The bridle should be a double one, with one “snaffle”
or jointed bit, and one curb-bit, each having, of course,
separate reins and headstalls. By-and-by you can use a
single bridle, if you prefer, with whichever bit you think
best suited to your hand and your horse’s mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The whip should be elastic and capable of giving a
sharp cut (though you may never need to administer
one with it), and it is convenient to have a loop of cord
or ribbon by which it may be hung to the wrist. A
good birch switch is better for your present purpose
than the usual flimsy “lady’s whip;” and if you are in
the country, it makes a good whip to begin with, as you
will probably soon wish to substitute a crop.</p>

<p>The place of instruction should be as retired as possible,
so that there may be nothing to distract the horse’s
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first few lessons it will be well, if you are not
thoroughly at home with horses, to have a man&mdash;some
friend or attendant&mdash;near at hand to give you confidence
by his presence, and to come to your aid in case
of necessity.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_I" id="LESSON_I">LESSON I.</a><br />
COMING TO THE WHIP.</h2>

<p>Have the horse brought saddled and bridled. Walk
quietly up in front of him, with your riding-whip under
your arm, and look him kindly in the face. See that
the bridle fits properly, as a careless groom may have
neglected to adjust it to the length of the head.</p>

<p>The <i>throat-latch</i> should be loose enough to permit the
chin to come easily to the breast; the bits should lie in
their proper place on the <i>bars</i>, and the curb-chain should
lie flat in the <i>chin groove</i>, just tight enough to allow
your fore-finger to pass under it. The <i>bars</i> are that part
of the gum between the <i>grinders</i>, or back teeth, and the
<i>nippers</i>, or front teeth, which in the mare is destitute of
teeth, and in the horse has a tusk called the <i>bridle-tooth</i>.</p>

<p>It is upon these bars, of course, that the bits should
lie, and the curb-bit, according to military rule, at an
inch above the tusk. By general usage they are placed
too high, the proper place of the curb-bit being not up
in the corner of the lips, but opposite or nearly opposite
the chin groove, which is just above the swell of the
lower lip. If the curb-chain is too loose the bit will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
“fall through,” or turn around in the mouth. If it is
too tight, or is ill adjusted, or if, from the bits being too
high, it slips up where the skin is thinner and the bones
sharper, it will give such pain that, to avoid it, the nose
will be thrust out instead of being brought in. The
chain should press below the snaffle, or the latter will
unhook it. Adjust and settle the various straps with
your hand, speaking kindly to your horse at the same
time; but when you have begun to teach him, reserve
all praises and caresses to reward him when he has done
well. It is a good plan to give him a lump of sugar before
you begin and after you finish each lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p><div class="center">
<a id="Illus_3" name="Illus_3"></a><img src="images/illus-016.png" width="600" height="496" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A PROPERLY FITTED CURB-CHAIN.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, standing in front of the horse, take both curb-reins
in the left hand at six inches below the bit, and,
with the whip held tip downward in the right hand,
strike him a light blow on the breast; in about a second
give him another, and continue striking at the same
interval, looking calmly at him the while, and following
him if he steps backward or sideways.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, and usually very soon, he will come
straight towards you; then instantly relax his head, say
“Bravo! bravo!” and stroke him on the face and neck.
You will very likely hear him give a deep sigh of relief,
like a frightened child. Give him half a minute
or more, according to circumstances, to look about and
recover from his nervousness&mdash;for you will find that
his nerves work a good deal like your own&mdash;and then
begin again, allowing him after every trial a half-minute
or so of rest.</p>

<p>It will not be long before he discovers that the way
to avoid the whip is to come straight to you, and he
will do so at the least motion of it. Take advantage
of this to make him curve his neck, put his head in the
proper perpendicular position, and bring his haunches
under him, by holding him back with the curb-reins as
he presses towards you. This lesson, to a careless observer,
looks rather pretty than useful, but is indispensable
for your purpose, for it gives you the means of
preventing the horse from backing while you are teaching
him the flexions of the jaw and of the neck. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
shows him, also, that the whip is only to be dreaded
when he disobeys, so that later on it will become in
your hands, strange as it may now seem to you, a powerful
means of calming his ardor and soothing his impatience,
and thus sparing your bridle-hand the sometimes
excessive fatigue of restraining his impetuosity.</p>

<p>In practice it is not necessary to carry this instruction
to the point where the horse will come to you
from so great a distance as shown in the accompanying
cut, though there is no difficulty in so doing.</p>

<p>A certain English nobleman used to say that a man
was as much above his ordinary self on horseback as
he was at other times above the brutes. Possibly more
than one young equestrian, remembering the exhilaration
of some morning ride, the quickened appreciation,
the redoubled enjoyment of the beauties of nature,
and of the charm of congenial companionship, will be
ready to echo the sentiment. It is only true, however,
even approximately, <i>when the rider controls all the
forces of the horse</i>, and it is the object of the present
article to put this perfect control within the reach of
every one willing to take the time and trouble to acquire
it, for not daring, but calmness, not strength, but
perseverance, are the qualities requisite.</p>

<p>Both time and trouble undoubtedly will be required,
for while, by even a careless use of this method, your
horse may be made vastly more comfortable under the
saddle, yet only by tact and patience can you win that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
mastery over his every volition by which his splendid
strength, courage, and endurance will seem to be added
to your own. You will find him, however, no tiresome
pupil. On the contrary, every day will increase your
pleasure both in his progress and in his companionship,
for he will soon become attached to you, and will now
and then turn his head and look at you with such an
expression in his eyes that you will think the old belief
in the transmigration of souls not so very wonderful
after all. You will, besides, find in your lessons no
contemptible discipline of character, for you will have
to conquer your natural timidity in feeling your weakness
opposed to his strength, to suppress your impatience
when he is slow of apprehension, to remain calm
when he is restive, and to award him your caresses, not
because his neck is sleek and beautiful, but because he
has done exactly as you directed. You will find also
that they will have a tendency to improve your seat, by
taking your attention from yourself, and with it some
of the involuntary stiffness always born of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>A different, but equally practical, result of knowing
something of horse-training is that wherever you may
be you will have no difficulty in getting a mount&mdash;no
small advantage either, as many an enthusiastic
young girl can testify as she remembers the stony look
which came over some comfortable farmer’s countenance
when she confidingly asked to ride one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
round-bellied horses. Many an owner of a trained saddle-horse
would gladly have him ridden carefully by
one capable of keeping him “in good form,” while
every horse-owner, no matter how poor his nags, dreads
an ignorant rider as he does the epizooty. Probably
scores of country stable-keepers and thousands of
farmers, after a season’s experience with ordinary city
riders, have vowed never to let a woman mount one of
their horses again. One of the former, at a popular
summer resort, said to the writer, “Two ladies hurt my
hosses more last summer than all the rest of the work.
They ain’t no more saddles to be found in my stable!”
A neighboring farmer, who had at first thought to reap
a golden harvest from his five excellent horses at a
dollar a ride, hereupon remarked, “They hain’t no
sense. They think a horse will go like a machine, and
all they’ve got to do is to turn steam on with the whip.”
Very different would have been the verdict had the
riders but possessed even a slight experience in training,
for the horses would have come from their hands
improved in mouth and gait, and almost certainly uninjured
by bad usage.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_II" id="LESSON_II">LESSON II.</a><br />
TO HOLD THE BIT LIGHTLY (<i>FLEXION DE LA MÂCHOIRE</i>),
USING THE CURB.</h2>

<p>Begin by assuring yourself that the horse has forgotten
nothing of the previous lesson. Do not allow him
to sidle up to you upon your movement of the whip
towards him, nor to twist his nose towards you, but make
him advance in a straight line.</p>

<p>Now, standing at the left of the horse’s head, with
your feet firmly planted a little way apart, take the left
snaffle-rein in the left hand, and the left curb-rein in
the right, at five or six inches from their respective bits,
and having brought the head into the proper perpendicular
position, pull the two hands apart with gentle but
steady force. Hold your whip, meanwhile, tip downward
in the right hand, to prevent him from running
back, which can be done without relaxing your pull by
tapping him with it upon the breast.</p>

<p>The object of this lesson, as well as of those which
follow, is to overcome involuntary muscular contraction.
In some cases, as probably in the present one, the contractions
are simply nervous, and will cease with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
mental cause; in others the muscles have grown into
improper positions, so that time will be required to set
them right.</p>

<div class="center">
<a id="Illus_4" name="Illus_4"></a><img src="images/illus-022.png" width="600" height="504" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FLEXION OF THE JAW&mdash;USING THE CURB.</p>
</div>

<p>Your object at present is to get the jaw relaxed, so
that you can move it at pleasure without resistance, and
this may take time and patience, for you must not be
satisfied with anything less than complete success, or
you will repent it later. At first, however, seize the
slightest involuntary opening of the horse’s mouth as
an excuse to relax your hold, caress and praise him, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
let him stand a half-minute with his head free, and begin
again.</p>

<p>When he is submissive, and pleased with you, he will
almost always show it by gently champing his bit; but
do not be deceived by a nervous simulation which you
will probably detect, and which consists in opening the
mouth a very little and immediately gripping the bit
again. You will have been completely successful when,
by simply drawing on the curb-reins, the head is brought
to the proper perpendicular position, and the bit, instead
of being gripped, is held lightly in the mouth, or, to use
the school term, when the horse is “light in hand.”</p>

<p>This is the only lesson in the series in which it is possible
(though not probable) that your unaided strength
may be insufficient; if so, get some one to help you over
the first resistance of the horse. With care and tact,
however, you will in all probability require no assistance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_III" id="LESSON_III">LESSON III.</a><br />
TO HOLD THE BIT LIGHTLY, USING THE SNAFFLE.</h2>

<p>Begin by repeating in proper order all that has been
done at the previous lessons. Now, having got the horse
“light in hand” with the curb, relax the curb-rein and
try to keep him light with the snaffle.</p>

<p>He will probably begin to bear on it. If so, restrain
him by successive tugs, punishing him a little with the
curb, if necessary, and always rewarding him with praises
and caresses when he does well. Avoid any violent use
of the curb, or the horse, in his efforts to escape the pain,
may get his tongue over the bit, and thus acquire a very
troublesome habit. It must be remembered that the bit
being the principal channel of communication between
his mind and yours, his whole attention is concentrated
upon it, and he is almost as much disconcerted by a sudden
harsh movement of it as you would be by an unexpected
shout in your ear.</p>

<p>By this time your groom is perhaps watching you
with interest, and may be trusted to repeat your handling,
thus saving you some time and trouble; but, as a
general thing, two lessons a day of from half to three-quarters
of an hour each, are as much as a horse can receive
with profit.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_IV" id="LESSON_IV">LESSON IV.</a><br />
TO LOWER THE HEAD.</h2>

<p>Always look over your horse before beginning your
instruction, to see that he has not met with any mishap.
Observe that his eye is bright and that he feels in good
spirits; run your eye over his limbs to detect any cut,
bruise, or swelling; see that the hoofs are not cracked.</p>

<p>Assure yourself that he is properly groomed&mdash;one
good test being the absence of scurf at the roots of the
mane; that his mouth has been sponged out before putting
in the bit, his hoofs wiped off clean&mdash;never, however,
blacked&mdash;and that he is properly saddled and bridled.
With a little practice you will do all this in half a minute,
while you are buttoning your gloves. About once
a week ask after his food and appetite, and make the
groom show you his shoes; and when the time comes
for him to be re-shod (which should be at least once a
month) positively forbid any trimming of the frog or
of the inside of the hoof&mdash;any “cleaning up of the foot,”
as farriers are pleased to call it. The only part to be
touched with the knife is the bottom of the outer, horny
shell, which is not half an inch thick; and even this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
must be cut with moderation, never burned by fitting
the shoe to it hot&mdash;the common makeshift of lazy farriers&mdash;nor
filed on the outside, as both these operations
not only weaken the hoof but impair Nature’s arrangement
for oiling and lubricating it. Should the horse
not bear equal weight on all four legs, move him a step
to see if the faulty posture may not have been acci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>dental;
and if it is repeated, examine the “favored”
leg, carefully laying your bare hand on the hoof and
joints to detect inflammation, feeling along the bones
for lumps, comparing any suspicious spot with the same
part of the corresponding leg, observing whether it is
warmer or more sensitive than its fellow.</p>

<p class="caption">LOWERING THE HEAD.</p>
</div>

<p>Having assured yourself that your horse is in perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
order, and that he has forgotten nothing of your previous
instruction, you will now proceed to the lesson of
the day. Place yourself on his left, or “near,” side,
take the snaffle-reins at a few inches from the bit, and
pull his head downward. Should he not yield, cross the
reins, by taking the right rein in the left hand and <i>vice
versa</i>, which will pinch his jaw sharply, and pull again
till he drops his head, when you will hold it down a
few seconds, praising him the while; then raise it up,
and allow him a little time to rest.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_V" id="LESSON_V">LESSON V.</a><br />
TO BEND THE NECK TO RIGHT AND LEFT, WITH THE REINS
HELD BELOW THE BIT (<i>FLEXIONS DE L’ENCOLURE</i>).</h2>

<p>Before beginning each lesson it is well, as has been
already recommended, to review hastily the instruction
previously given.</p>

<p>Now place yourself on the left side of your horse,
with your riding-whip tip downward in your right
hand, and with your feet firmly planted a little apart.
Take the right curb-rein in your right hand at about six
inches from the lever of the bit, and the left curb-rein
in your left at three inches from the lever, and having
brought the horse’s head to a perpendicular position,
pull the two hands steadily apart, moving the right
hand to the right and the left hand to the left, so as to
pry the horse’s head around to the right by means of
the twist of the bit in his mouth. If he offers to back,
stop him by tapping his breast with the whip; if he
tries to pull away his head, hold on tight, until presently
he will turn his head to the right, when you will instantly
say, “Bravo! bravo!” and after holding it so a
few seconds, bring it back to its original position. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
soon he will take the idea, and you will bring his head
around until it faces backward, being careful to keep it
always exactly perpendicular, and not to allow the horse
to move it of his own accord in any direction.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">“PULLING THE HANDS STEADILY APART.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now try to obtain this flexion with the right-hand
rein alone, only using the left hand to assist it if he fails
to understand or to obey, and also to bring back the head
to its original position.</p>

<p>To bend the neck to the left requires simply a reversal
of the process just described, and will give you probably
no trouble. Do not be satisfied with anything else
than an easy, graceful, and patient obedience on the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the horse. Should he back or fidget out of his place,
bring him back to it before going on, as you will find
that his associations (unconscious, doubtless) with place
are remarkable, and that any fault is likely to be repeated
on the spot where it was first committed.</p>

<p>When he will look backward on either side, and remain
looking so upon your drawing upon the proper
rein, the lesson is perfect. The utility of it may not
appear at first, but will be evident at a later stage of
your instructions.</p>

TO BEND THE NECK TO RIGHT AND LEFT, WITH THE REINS
THROWN OVER THE NECK.</h2>

<p>Take the left snaffle-rein in the left hand at about a
foot from the bit, and with the right hand draw the
right snaffle-rein over the horse’s neck just in front of
the shoulder, until both sides pull equally on the bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and the horse is “light in hand.” Then, by drawing
upon the right rein gradually, bend his head around to
the right, gently feeling the left rein so as to keep the
bit straight in the mouth and prevent him from moving
faster than you wish; for in this, as in all other cases,
while he is to do exactly what you direct, he is to do
nothing more.</p>

</div>

<p>To bend the neck to the left, you will, of course, reverse
the operation above described, standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
other side of the horse, taking the right snaffle-rein in
the right hand at a foot from the bit, and drawing the
left rein over the shoulder with the left hand. Keep
the horse “light in hand” all the time, and his head
perfectly perpendicular, as any twisting of the nose to
one side has a ludicrous appearance. Now repeat with
the curb.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_VII" id="LESSON_VII">LESSON VII.</a><br />
TO MOVE THE CROUP TO RIGHT AND LEFT WITH THE
WHIP.</h2>

<p>It is unfortunate that we have not in English a vocabulary
of definite terms relating to the training and
riding of horses. We will for convenience call all that
part of the horse in front of the saddle the <i>forehand</i>,
and all that part back of the saddle the <i>croup</i>.</p>

<p>Take both snaffle-reins in the left hand at a few
inches from the bit, and standing near the horse’s left
shoulder, get him “light in hand” with the bit; and if
his hind-legs are not well under him, make him bring
them forward by tapping him gently on the rump with
your extended whip, keeping the forehand motionless
by your hold on the bit.</p>

<p>Now, holding his head so that he will not move his
left fore-foot, tap him lightly on the left flank near the
hip until he moves the croup one step to the right.</p>

<p>Then pat and praise him, and if he has not moved
his right fore-foot, tap his right leg with the whip to
make him bring it forward even with the left. After
a little rest begin again, asking and allowing only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
step at a time, and persevering until he will move the
croup one step over to each tap of the whip, pivoting
on the left fore-foot and walking the right foot by little
steps around it.</p>

<div class="center">
<a id="Illus_11" name="Illus_11"></a><img src="images/illus-039.png" width="600" height="438" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MOVING THE CROUP ONE STEP TO THE RIGHT.</p>
</div>

<p>When he is perfect with the snaffle, repeat the process
with the curb, keeping his hind-legs well under him,
and holding him “light in hand,” while maintaining
his left fore-foot immovable, with a delicate touch, to
resemble as much as possible the action of the rein
when drawn from the saddle.</p>

<p>Now repeat the process to the left, taking your stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
near the right shoulder, and, with both snaffle-reins in
your right hand and the whip in your left, proceed
as before until the horse will walk one step at each tap
of the whip around the right fore-foot, which should
in its turn be kept so firmly in place as to bore a hole
in the ground. Repeat with the curb.</p>

<p>This lesson, which will last, very likely, two or three
days, may appear to some of no practical utility, but it
is indispensable alike to your comfort when mounted,
to the safety of those who accompany or meet you, and
to the continued education of your horse. Who has
not seen an untrained animal force his rider to dismount
to lift some gate-latch which was really within
easy reach, or prancing about in a crowd, to the terror
and vexation of his neighbors, or in momentary
danger of hooking his legs into the wheels of passing
vehicles?</p>

<p>Now, if you trample on any one, or upset a light
vehicle, though you risk, and perhaps break, your own
bones, yet you are liable for damages; and this fact is
so well known that a suit will be promptly begun
against you. Besides, for your own sake you must
have it in your power to get your horse’s haunches,
and with them your own person, out of danger from
careless or mischievous drivers&mdash;just as a cavalryman
has to save his horse from a slash or thrust.</p>

MOUNTED.</h2>

<p><i>To Advance at Touch of Heel and Stop at Touch of
Whip on Back.</i>&mdash;Your horse’s education must now be
carried on from the saddle, and should he never have
been ridden, it will be prudent to have a man mount
him first upon a man’s saddle, and afterwards upon your
side-saddle, with a blanket wrapped around the legs to
simulate a skirt. If the previous lessons have been carefully
given, you will have no trouble in making him
stand wherever you please while you mount, nor in getting
him “light in hand” afterwards. First, however, see
that the saddle fits snugly in its place, and that the girths
are good and in order. If there are more than two, let
the third be loose while the others are tight. The writer
once saw a powerful horse burst two good English girths
by a sudden bound and throw off his rider, saddle and
all. If the girths and saddle are not very strong, put a
broad, thin strap&mdash;a surcingle will do&mdash;over all.</p>

GETTING A HORSE ACCUSTOMED TO SKIRTS.<br />
(An example of the “flying trot.”)</p>
</div>

<p>Being mounted, gather the reins all into the left hand
in the following manner: Draw the right snaffle-rein
between the fore and middle fingers, and the left snaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>fle
rein under the little finger into the palm, throwing
the ends forward together over the first finger, to be
held by the thumb; in like manner draw the curb-reins
into the palm on each side of the ring-finger, the left
rein, of course, below, and the right above it, throwing
the ends, like those of the snaffle, forward over the fore-finger
and under the thumb. Now taking the curb-rein
by the seam, draw it through your fingers till both reins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
fall equally on the bit; then do the same by the snaffle,
but draw it so much tighter than the curb that the latter
will hang loose, and any movement of your hand
will be felt through the snaffle. Grasp all the reins
firmly, your hand back upward, with wrist a little bent
and elbow near your side, so that if the horse, stumbling,
thrust his nose suddenly out, you will not be
jerked from the saddle.</p>

</div>

<p>All this you will quickly get the knack of, and do as
easily as you would thread a needle. You will observe
that, having the width of three fingers between the
two snaffle-reins, you can, by bending your wrist to
right or left, guide the horse as easily as with the reins
in both hands. Get the horse “light in hand” by the
usual play of the bit, first the curb, then the snaffle,
tapping him on the right side, just forward of the girth,
if he fails to respond or offers to back.</p>

</div>

<p>Now press him just back of the girth with your left
heel, at the same time relaxing the rein a little. If he
steps forward, pat and praise him, but if not, press him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
more firmly, at the same time touching him as before
with the whip. When he moves forward praise him,
and after a few seconds stop him, leaning back a little
and laying your whip by a turn of the wrist on his back
just behind the saddle. Then recommence, and persevere
until he will start promptly forward at the touch
of the heel, and stop at the touch of the whip on his
back, keeping “light in hand” the while. If he is very
sluggish you may have to strike him smartly for not
answering instantly to the heel, but he will soon learn
not to wait for the blow. Let the heel act close to the
girth, as you will soon wish to move the croup over by
the same means applied farther back. It is well not to
start with the whip, nor by chirping or clucking, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is as likely to excite your companion’s horse as your
own, and is annoying to most people.</p>

<p>After riding have the saddle removed, and should a
puffy spot appear on the back where it has pressed, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the hint at once and have the padding eased over the
place, or a tedious and vexatious “saddle-gall” may

however, it is an excellent plan to bathe the back with

<p>The several instruments of torture represented in the

<i>cavesson</i> around his nose, and the <i>lunging-cord</i> in the
hands of the groom&mdash;to whom the artist has very properly

old times, would have lent a hand at the rack or the

reins, which are adjusted so as to hold the head in the
proper position. The cavesson is a broad leather band,
stiffened with iron, which is fastened around the nose
just where the cartilage joins the bone, so that a tug
upon it causes great pain, and will bring anything but
determined vice to submission. These appliances are
usually only the resort of laziness or ignorance, for none
of them can for a moment compare with the human
hand; and in fact they effect no saving in time, for it
is not safe to leave a horse a minute alone with a dumb-jockey
on his back, as he may rear and fall over backward
at the risk of his life. The writer knew of an
accident of this kind which ended the victim’s usefulness
in the saddle, and he has seen a strong and proud
horse sweat profusely, with the thermometer at ten degrees
below the freezing point, while being <i>lunged</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
driven in a ring, with a dumb-jockey on.</p>

MOUNTED.</h2>

<p><i>To Bend the Neck to Right and Left.</i>&mdash;You can
now, if you please, substitute a stiff <i>crop</i> for the flexible
whip you have so far made use of. Having taken your
place in the saddle and got your horse light in hand
review the previous lesson; then, having your horse
still carefully light in hand and light on foot&mdash;that
is, with hind-feet well under him&mdash;draw gently upon
the left snaffle-rein. When the horse’s head has come
around to your knee, keep it in that position an instant,
and then put it straight again by drawing upon the
right rein, insisting that his face remains perpendicular
during the whole operation. Now go through the
same process with the right snaffle-rein, and then repeat
the whole operation with the curb. These flexions of
the neck may now seem to you of doubtful utility, but
as the education of the horse advances, your opinion
will change. It is as rare for horses as for people to
have a noble and graceful carriage; and while you
cannot, of course, really change the shape of your
mount, yet you can, by care, entirely change his appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a><br /><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ance.
His various gaits you can indeed improve, but
for his <i>style</i> he depends, nine times out of ten, entirely
upon you, and if you are indifferent he will be careless
and probably clumsy.</p>

THE WALK.</h2>

<p>This gait is apt to be hardly appreciated by youthful
equestrians, whose love of excitement leads them often
to prefer rapidity to grace of motion; but it can, with
a little painstaking, be made swift and agreeable; and
certainly, when light and animated, it shows off both
horse and rider to better advantage than any other.
It is, besides, an indispensable stage in the bitting of
the horse; for until he will continue “light” while
starting, stopping, and turning at a walk, he should not
be put to a faster pace.</p>

<p>Your chief difficulty will be his propensity to drop
into a jog-trot as soon as you try to quicken his steps;
but this must be overcome by stopping him immediately
and then recommencing the walk, urging him forward
with the heel and encouraging him to lift his feet
quickly by a delicate play of the bit, but leaving his
head as free as possible. This will give you occupation,
probably, for several days. Do not forget to praise him
when he does well.</p>

<p>TO MOVE THE CROUP WITH HEEL AND WHIP (<i>PIROUETTE
RENVERSÉE</i>).</p>

<p>Having your horse light in hand and light on foot
(that is to say, as we have before explained, with his
face perpendicular, the bit held lightly, and his weight
well supported on his hind-legs), tap him on the right
flank with your whip or “crop” till he moves the
croup one step to the left. Your great difficulty will
be to prevent him from moving his right fore-foot,
which by careful play of the bit you must endeavor
to keep fixed to the ground, while at each tap of the
whip the other three feet move one step around it.
When this lesson has been satisfactorily learned, proceed
to teach in like manner the movement of croup
to the right, pivoting on the left fore-foot, substituting,
however, for the tap of the whip a pressure with the
left heel, applied as far behind the girth as possible.</p>

<p>Should he not understand this pressure, interpret it
to him with the whip. As long as there seems to be
any mental effort required on his part, pause after each
step to caress and praise him. Be careful to keep him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br /><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
calm while learning, or he may tread one foot upon the
other, possibly inflicting a severe wound, and after dismounting
inspect his feet carefully to make sure that
this has not happened.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XII" id="LESSON_XII">LESSON XII.</a><br />
TO GUIDE “BRIDLEWISE.”</h2>

<p>Up to this time your horse has been guided as in
driving, by a pull upon one side of the bit, that is to
say, upon one corner of the mouth, and it is time now
to substitute a simple pressure of the rein upon his
neck. The chief difficulty to be encountered is in the
fact that, as the rein is attached to the bit, the tension
of it against one side of the neck pulls the bit on that
side, consequently conveying to the horse an impression
exactly opposite to that intended. This difficulty must
be overcome by patience, for this instruction cannot be
completed in a single lesson, but will have to be carried
on simultaneously with other work for a week or more.
It is given by carrying your hand over, whenever you
turn, to the side towards which you wish to go, so that
the reins will press against the neck. Thus, if you
wish to turn to the left, draw on the left snaffle-rein,
and as the horse answers to it, carry your hand to the
left, so that the right reins press against the right side
of the neck. This must be done with judgment, or the
bit, being pulled too hard on the right side by the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>sion
of the rein on the neck, will stop him in his turn.
Of course you will seek as many occasions as possible
for turning, choosing, in preference, places where your
intention cannot be misunderstood, as at a corner, for
instance. There is no better spot than some old orchard,
for the horse instantly takes the idea of going
around a tree, and there will be more or less shade, and
probably good turf. While he is learning this lesson
do not distract his attention by other instruction; but
as soon as he has mastered it, see that his head is always
turned in the direction towards which he is to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
for it is a habit with horses, as awkward as it is common,
to turn one way and look the other. At the same
time always lean in your saddle towards the centre of
the curve you are describing, and at an angle increasing
in proportion to your speed.</p>

<p class="caption">GUIDING BRIDLEWISE (TURNING TO THE RIGHT).</p>
</div>

<p>Some English writers depreciate the above method
of guiding the horse, preferring to use the bit exclusively,
but it is almost universal in the United
States, and its advantages for ordinary riders are
numerous and evident. Indeed, Stonehenge, a well-known
English authority, says that in “this way a horse
can be turned with a much greater degree of nicety
and smoothness than by acting on the corner of his
mouth.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XIII" id="LESSON_XIII">LESSON XIII.</a><br />
THE TROT.</h2>

<p>Writers on the horse distinguish three kinds of trot,
<i>viz.</i>, the “jog” trot, the “true” trot, and the “flying”
or “American” trot. In the first the feet remain longer
on the ground than in the air, and lazy animals are
naturally fond of it, while spirited horses sometimes
drop into it from impatience of walking. It is, however,
apt to be a slovenly gait, which, though easy to
the rider, should hardly be permitted.</p>

<p>In the flying trot the horse leaps a considerable distance
through the air at each stride&mdash;evidently a mode
of progression unsuited for ladies, who must attain
speed in trotting by quickening the step without undue
lengthening of the stride.</p>

<p>Your first care will be to prevent your horse from
losing his “lightness,” as he will be inclined to do at
every change of gait or increase of speed&mdash;and this,
while often by no means easy, is yet a task to be thoroughly
accomplished if you wish for comfort or style
in the future. You will observe in trotting, as in all
other gaits, at each step a slight tug on the rein, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by some writers the <i>appel</i>, and this you will ordinarily
yield your hand to, so as to keep a steady feeling of the
mouth.</p>

<p>If, however, the horse begins to bear on the bit, hold
your hand firmly, with the rein just so tight that at
every step he will himself thrust his jaw against the
curb. This will very likely bring him to his senses
and restore his lightness, and if so, pat and praise him;
but if not, tap him on the side with your whip, at the
same time pulling on the curb for a second or two. If
he does not yield to this, repeated two or three times,
stop him short; and when, by the same method, you
have got him to relax his gripe of the bit and arch his
neck, allow him to go on again. He will dislike excessively
to be stopped and started in this way, and
when he finds that he will not be permitted to go in
any way but the right one he will give up the attempt.</p>

<p>Do not try to succeed by giving a long, steady pull,
nor by using force, as it will do no good, and may cause
the tongue to be put over the bit&mdash;a very troublesome
trick. Remember, in stopping, to lean back, and lay
your whip, by a movement of the wrist, on the horse’s
back.</p>

<p>You will next turn your attention to your horse’s
gait. As the trot is rarely so easy that a lady can sit
down to it with comfort, it is advisable to rise in the
stirrup.</p>

<p>This is difficult and fatiguing if the stride is too long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and you will therefore prevent its extending too much
by giving a little tug on the rein just as each step is
made, at the same time with the heel keeping up speed
and animation.</p>

<p>If your bitting has been thoroughly done, and your
horse’s mouth is fine and sensitive, you will probably
find the snaffle best for trotting, and you will give a
steady support with it.</p>

<p>Keep the step quick, elastic, perfectly cadenced, and
without any rolling of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Should you happen to be mounted upon a horse
which, from bad handling or his own faulty conformation,
is disposed to “bore,” or bear on his bit, you
will ride with the curb, taking its reins in one hand,
but in the other hand taking the snaffle, with the left
rein drawn much tighter than the right. This will
have an effect quite different from what one might
expect, and will put a stop to this most fatiguing and
annoying trick.</p>

<p>This recipe is not found in Baucher’s book, but is
said to have been given by him verbally to his pupils,
and it is really “a trick worth knowing.” If it does
not have the desired effect, however, when practised
with the left snaffle-rein, try it with the right, as the
mouth&mdash;for instance, from the effect of double harness&mdash;may
not be equally sensitive on both sides.</p>

<p>If you observe that the step of one foot is shorter
than that of the other, making the horse appear lame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
you may be almost sure you have fallen into the too
common feminine practice of bearing too much of your
weight on one side. An even balance in the saddle is
of capital importance, and a rough-and-ready test is to
observe whether the buttons of your habit are in the
same plane as the horse’s backbone, and your shoulders
nearly equidistant from his ears&mdash;points of which you
can judge as well as any one.</p>

<p>In the matter of the horse’s gait you must be equally
exacting, not resting so long as you can perceive the
slightest irregularity or difference between the strides.
It is desirable to cultivate such a sensitiveness to all
the horse’s movements as will enable you to know
where his feet are at all times without looking, and the
first step towards this is to learn to “sit close to the
saddle.” This firm and easy seat, coveted by every
rider, is attained by some with much greater difficulty
than by others. Many riders will bump about on their
saddles for thousands of miles without being “shaken
into their seat,” because they neither abandon themselves
to the instinct which correctly guides a child,
nor, on the other hand, seek out and remove the cause,
in the muscular contractions of the body and limbs.</p>

<p>A loose sack of grain set upright on horseback does
not jump up and down, and, while it is not desirable to
be quite so inert as a bag of grain, yet a lesson may be
learned from it&mdash;which is, that the lower part of the
person, from the hips to the knees, should be kept firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>ly
and steadily, though not stiffly, in place, while the
waist, with the back bent slightly inward, should be as
flexible as possible, and the whole upper part of the
person pliant and supple, so as to yield with a certain
<i>nonchalance</i> to every movement.</p>

<p>Nervous riders, like nervous horses, are those in
whom involuntary muscular contractions persist the
most obstinately.</p>

<p>As both of the horse’s strides are equal when the
trot is true, it seems nonsense to talk, as some writers
do, about the “leading foot” in trotting; and except
that few horses are so perfectly symmetrical that both
strides are equally elastic, there should be no difference
to a man on which one he “rises,” and he will therefore
spare that foot and leg which, for any cause, he
may suppose to be the weaker. A lady will without
effort find the stride best suited to her.</p>

<p>Horses are often trained in our Western States to
trot when the rider touches the back of their neck,
and to single-foot or pace when he makes play gently
with the curb-bit. These signals are injudicious, because
in harness a slight movement of the bit sets the
horse so trained to single-footing, and there is no way
to communicate to him your wish that he should trot.
It is better, therefore, to give the signal to trot by
taking a firm hold of the snaffle, and laying your whip
gently on his hind-quarter while you incite to speed
with your heel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>After dismounting, observe whether your horse has
<i>interfered</i>&mdash;that is, struck one or more of his fetlock
joints with his hoofs; should the skin be knocked off,
apply some healing ointment; and if the joint swells,
bathe with water as hot as the hand will bear. This is
the best remedy for all ordinary bruises and sprains.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XIV" id="LESSON_XIV">LESSON XIV.</a><br />
THE GALLOP, HAND-GALLOP, AND CANTER.</h2>

<p>These are treated of by some writers as distinct, the
canter being called “purely artificial;” but it will be
convenient and sufficiently accurate for our purpose to
take them up together and to consider the canter as
what it in fact is&mdash;an <i>improved</i>, and not an “artificial,”
gait. Horses undoubtedly often canter in a rude way
without being taught, as may be seen often in the field,
and not seldom in harness, and you will probably have
little trouble in getting your horse to do the same. It
is this natural canter which is called by country people
the “lope.” It is of importance, however, that your
horse should not change his gait without orders, no
matter how hard pressed, this being especially true if
he is to be driven as well as ridden. The signal to
canter should, therefore, be such as can be given only
from the saddle. It is well not to use the whip for the
purpose, but to try by raising the bridle to lift the
forehand, while stimulating at the same time with the
heel. Should he persist in trotting, do not get vexed
or discouraged, for he is only resisting temptation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
do what he has expressly been taught not to do; but
continue your incitements, raising the bridle-hand firmly
at every stride till you have got him fairly off his
feet into a gallop, when you will soothe his nerves by
patting and praising him, and gradually calm him down
into a canter, lifting your hand at every stride to prevent
his relapsing into a trot. When he will canter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
promptly at the signal, you will get him “light in hand”
before giving it; then make him start without thrusting
out his nose, and keep him light by the means already
detailed in the lesson on the trot. Next you
will bring his haunches forward under him, which is
the great point, and increase the brilliancy of his action
by stimulating him with heel and whip, while at each
step you restrain him by a gentle pull, so that he will
not spring forward so far as he intended. Persevere
until he will canter as slowly as he would walk. Your
best guide will be to observe the action of some well-trained
and well-ridden horse, and to endeavor to obtain
the same in yours.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CANTER.</p>
</div>

<p>To <i>change the leading foot</i> in cantering is, however,
a more difficult matter, and we will postpone the consideration
of it until his education is a little farther
advanced. In the mean time you will avoid turning a
sharp corner at a canter.</p>

<p>The hand-gallop is simply a moderate gallop in which
the ear observes three beats,</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/music-66a.png" width="410" height="55" alt="" />
</div>

<p>as in the canter, but swifter; while in the extended
gallop it hears but two,</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/music-66b.png" width="316" height="55" alt="" />
</div>

<p>though given with a sort of rattle, which shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
neither the fore nor the hind feet strike the ground
exactly together, as they do in leaping.</p>

<p><i>Keep to the left, as the law directs</i>, is an admonition
on bridges and other thoroughfares in England which
has often excited the surprise of Americans, very likely
eliciting some such comment as “How stupid!” “How
perfectly ridiculous!” Yet for many centuries it was
really the only safe way to turn, whether on foot or on
horseback, and as all our fashions of riding and driving
are based upon it, it is hard to see why the custom
should have changed in this country. In the olden
time, when people went about principally on horseback,
when roads were lonely and footpads plenty, it would
have been “perfectly ridiculous” for a man to turn to
the right and expose his defenceless bridle-arm to a
blow from a bludgeon or slash from a hanger. Much
more would it have been so had he a lady under his
care, who would thus be left in the very front of danger,
whether it might be of robbery from highwaymen,
of insult from roistering riders, or of simple injury
from passing vehicles. At the present day and in this
country the danger last mentioned is the only one
really to be feared, and it is so considerable that the
question is often raised whether a lady be not safer at
the right of her cavalier; but the still greater danger
in this case of her being crushed between the horses, in
case of either one springing suddenly towards the other,
has caused it thus far to be decided in the negative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
There is also always a possibility&mdash;slight, doubtless&mdash;of
a lady’s getting kicked or bitten when on the right; and
it might be difficult for her companion, without risk to
her limbs, to seize her horse by the head should he become
refractory. In case of its becoming absolutely
necessary to take a terrified or exhausted rider off of an
unmanageable horse, there would probably be time for
her escort to cross behind her and place himself at her
left hand.</p>

<p>Now that we are on the subject, we may give a word
of caution as to some other dangers of the road.
Among those to the rider, the most common is <i>shying</i>;
but vigilance&mdash;and perpetual vigilance will be necessary&mdash;will
reduce this to the rank of simple annoyance.
Get your horse past the alarming object somehow, even
if he has to be led; get him up to it if you can, and
then pat and praise him; never let him hurry off after
passing it; never whip him afterwards.</p>

<p>Rearing is less common than shying, but more dangerous
from the risk of pulling the horse over backward.
To rear he must, of course, spring up with the
fore-legs, and if his intention can be divined in time it
may perhaps be frustrated by a smart stroke down the
shoulder; but an active animal is usually up before his
rider has had time to think, and the question is how to
come safe down again. To this end, on no account
pull on the bit, but, without letting go the rein, grasp a
thick lock of the mane and hold yourself with it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
close to the neck as possible&mdash;which will throw
your weight in the best place, and prepare you to leap
down, should it be necessary. If you have kept perfectly
calm, so that the horse has not suspected that
you were frightened, he will doubtless come down on
his feet, and very likely may not rear again. If, however,
you feel his hind-legs sink under him, he will be
intending to throw himself down, and you must jump
down instantly to avoid getting caught under the
saddle.</p>

<p>Kicking, when coming unexpectedly, is more likely
than rearing to unseat the rider. If you withstand
the first assault, however, get the horse’s head up by an
energetic use of the bit, and look out that he does not
get it down again. It is needless to say that should
either of the last two tricks become a habit, it will
make the horse quite unfit for a lady’s use.</p>

<p>If your horse is restless and disposed to jump, or
perhaps run, when horses or vehicles rapidly approach
him from behind, occupy his attention by moving the
bit a little from side to side in his mouth.</p>

<p>Running away is undoubtedly serious business, but
all authorities agree that the safest plan is to let the
horse run, if there is room, and that the best lesson for
him is to make him continue running after he wishes
to stop. A steady pull on the bit is quite useless, and
so is any cry of “Whoa! whoa!” at first. But after a
little the bit should be vigorously <i>sawed</i>, so as to sway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the head from side to side if possible, and thus confuse
him, while you speak to him in a commanding tone.</p>

<p>The dangers to the horse upon the road, however,
are greater and more numerous than to yourself, but
they may almost all be averted by care and watchfulness
on your part. Beware of a fast pace on hard
macadam; beware of loose stones, which may bruise
the frog or cause a tedious sprain; beware of food,
water, above all, of currents of air when he is warm.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XV" id="LESSON_XV">LESSON XV.</a><br />
THE PIROUETTE, DEUX PISTES, PASSAGE.</h2>

<p>In the <i>pirouette ordinaire</i> of the French <i>manége</i> the
horse turns upon one of his hind-legs, walking on the
other three around it, just as in the <i>pirouette renversée</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of Lesson XI. he turned upon one of the fore-legs,
around which he walked upon the other three; and
now, as then, the chief difficulty is to keep him from
moving the leg which is to serve as a pivot. The
means for accomplishing this you have already ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a><br /><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>quired,
and a pressure of the heel on the one side, or
of the crop on the other, will prevent an intended
movement of the croup, while by the rein against the
neck you move the forehand to the one side or to the
other. In wheeling to the left it is the left hind-foot,
and to the right the right hind-foot, which serves as a
pivot. If your horse is stiff and clumsy in this exercise
it will probably be because you have not got him
together, with his hind-legs well under him, but at best
you will probably find him less supple on one side than
the other. Begin by moving the forehand but one step
at a time, keeping your horse calm, so that he may not
wound one foot with the other, holding your own person
motionless, and gradually accustoming him to slight
and delicate effects of hand, heel, and whip, so that he
may to a by-stander appear to move of his own volition.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>piste</i> (literally “trail” or “track”) in the French
<i>manége</i> is an imaginary circle lying three feet distant
from the wall; which imaginary line, however, becomes
in practice a well-defined path, which the horse soon
learns to follow with little guidance from his rider. To
go, then, “on two <i>pistes</i>” is to cause the horse to advance
with his body placed obliquely, so that the hind-feet
move on a different line from the fore-feet. In
the cut the horse is shown directly across the <i>piste</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_XVI" id="LESSON_XVI">LESSON XVI.</a><br />
BACKING.</h2>

<p>This lesson has been deferred thus far because, while
it is one of the most practically and frequently useful,
yet it is also the method which the horse naturally takes
to escape from the unwonted constraint put upon the
muscles of his neck and jaw in the course of the preceding
lessons. You have had, therefore, to be on your
guard hitherto against it; and had you taught it earlier
you would have found your horse cunning enough to
pretend to believe every play of the bit to be a signal to
step back, and thus protract the instruction.</p>

<p>Having, then, got your horse, as usual, well in hand,
lean back and give a pull on the reins. If he steps back,
well; if not, touch him with the heel or tap his side
with the crop, and when he lifts his foot to step forward
repeat the pull on the reins, when the foot will
be replaced farther back; then pat and praise him, and
persevere until he will, at each tug of the reins, move
backward one step and no more.</p>

<p>Should he swerve to right or left, straighten him by
a tap or pressure of the crop on his right side, or by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
pressure of the heel on the left, as the case may require.</p>

<p>Your horse having learned to obey the pressure of the
rein upon the neck, you may now, if you choose, adopt
another method of holding the reins. It differs from
that described in Lesson XIII. in that the two snaffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
reins, instead of being separated by three fingers, have
only one&mdash;the middle finger&mdash;between them; while the

snaffle-reins, come in below, having the little finger inserted
between them.</p>

between the reins separated by the left little finger,

and allowing the ends to pass out to the right.</p>

RIDING IN CIRCLES.&mdash;CHANGE OF LEADING FOOT.</h2>

<p>You are now prepared to practise with profit a simple
exercise, which you will find interesting to yourself, and,
if carefully done, very improving to your horse. It is
the riding in circles of small diameter. Mark out a
number of rings of various sizes in some pasture-field
with white pebbles or beans or small scraps of white paper,
which may be scattered at intervals of two or three
feet, so that the figures may not be remarked by the
horse, but that he may receive his instruction from you
only. Let the circles touch one another, so that you
may change from one into the other, and thus turn to
the right and left alternately. Begin at a walk, then
proceed to a trot, practising first on the large circles,
and then taking the smaller ones. Keep your horse
“light in hand,” and do not let him place his body across
the line, but make him follow it accurately, with his
neck and body bent around to the curve which it describes.
When he is perfect in this exercise on level
ground, move to some hill-side and begin again. When
he can do figure 8’s of a small size accurately at a smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
trot on a pretty steep slope, you may congratulate your
self on having made good progress, and may begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
do the large circles on level ground at a canter. Here
comes in the troublesome matter of the “leading foot,”
and if you do not understand it, you must not be discouraged,
for many persons ride “hit or miss” their
whole lives long without thinking or knowing anything
about it. The expression, besides, is misleading, and
you will do well to study up the subject first on straight
lines. Get a friend to canter beside you, and observe
the motion of his horse’s feet. You will see that the
two fore-feet and the two hind-feet strike the ground
not only one later than the other, but one in advance of
the other, and that the one which leaves the ground last
steps past the other and is planted farthest forward. It
is this foot taking the long stride which is called, although
it moves last, the “leading foot.”</p>

<p class="caption">LEADING WITH THE RIGHT FORE-FOOT.</p>
</div>

<p>It ought not to make any difference to the horse
with which foot he leads, nor to his rider, if a man, so
long as he follows a straight line; but whenever he has
to turn, it becomes both to horse and rider of importance&mdash;if
the curve is sharp, of very great importance&mdash;that
he should lead on the side towards which he is to
turn.</p>

<p>A little observation of your companion’s horse when
turning will make the reason clear to you. A woman’s
seat being on the left side of the horse, it is easier for
her that the shoulder having the most motion should be
on the right side, and ladies’ saddle-horses are consequently
trained to lead with the right foot; the result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
we may remark, often being that the fore-foot which
does most work gives out before the others.</p>

<div class="center">
<a id="Illus_28" name="Illus_28"></a><img src="images/illus-082.png" width="483" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LEADING WITH THE LEFT FORE-FOOT.</p>
</div>

<p>The horse so trained, however, is in this way always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
ready to wheel to the right; but when he turns to the
left, whether carrying man or woman, he must change
and lead with the left foot; and if he has not sense
enough to do so himself, you must teach him.</p>

<p>This, really, is not an easy task for an amateur, especially
for the amateur feminine, who has not the efficient
masculine resource of a pair of spurred heels. Even
with their aid a man is often so embarrassed to make
his horse comprehend that he gives up the attempt, and
contents himself with “slowing down” before turning,
his failure usually resulting from the insufficient previous
training of the horse, coupled with his own ignorance
of the successive short steps by which the latter
may be led up to the performance of the wished-for
act.</p>

<p>If you have been exact in the instruction hitherto
given&mdash;if your bitting has been so thorough that your
horse remains “light in hand” during all the manœuvres
described in the foregoing lessons; if he responds instantly
to the pressure of the rein upon the neck, and
to the touch of the heel and of the whip upon the flank,
so that you can move the forehand and the croup separately
or at the same time in the same or in opposite
directions; if he will rise from a walk into a canter
without trotting; and if, finally, your drilling in the
flexions of the neck permits you to bend his head to
right or left when at rest or in motion without affecting
the position of the forehand&mdash;then your horse is thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>oughly
prepared for the present lesson; and the same
tact and patience which have brought you on thus far
will assuredly carry you triumphantly through it.</p>

<p>First, however, you should learn to tell with which
foot you are leading, and you can do so by leaning forward
in the saddle while cantering, when you will see
that the knee of the leading leg is thrown up higher
than its fellow, and by bending still farther you may
see this foot planted in advance upon the ground. If
your horse has never been trained, it is as likely to be
one foot as the other. Now, the first step to be taken
is to put your horse in such a position that it will be
easy and natural for him to lead off with the desired
foot, and awkward to lead off with the other. This
position is with the head turned in the direction you
wish to go, and with the croup advanced a little in the
same direction, so that the body is placed obliquely
across the line of advance. Thus, if you wish to lead
with the right foot, you keep his head turned in the
direction you wish to go, while with the heel you move
the croup over two steps to the right; then, touching
him with the heel and raising the hand, you give the
signal to canter, and he will probably lead off with the
right foot. If not, stop him and try again, giving him
a sharp cut with your whip just behind the right shoulder.
To lead with the left the process is reversed, the
croup being moved two steps to the left before the
signal to canter is given, a sudden dig with the heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
behind the shoulder conveying to the horse the hint to
hurry forward his left leg. You can now begin to canter
on the circles you have marked out; you will, however,
at first come down to a walk before changing from
one circle to an adjoining one&mdash;which change, of course,
reverses the curve, and makes it necessary to change the
leading foot.</p>

<p>This figure eight riding, thus, <span class="xlarge">∞</span>, is most useful both
for horse and rider when it is carefully done. Keep the
horse “light in hand,” and above all, <i>collected</i>&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, with
his haunches well under him, and always with his feet
exactly in the circle and his neck and body bent to the
curve. As soon as he will lead off correctly from a
walk, begin to teach him to do so from the trot; and
when this lesson has been learned, practise him on the
double circles, or figure 8’s, beginning at a trot, and lifting
him into a canter just as you pass from one circle
to the other. This will accustom him to the idea
of a change of movement at the time of a change in
direction. Having got him to canter, continue on the
same circle many times around and around, then bring
him to a trot, and pass to the adjoining circle, lifting
him to a canter just as you turn into it, as before, but
of course leading with the opposite foot. Make your
circles smaller and smaller, and continue till he has had
time to appreciate the importance of leading correctly;
then try to make him change at a canter, choosing for
the purpose one of your smallest figure 8’s, and indicat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ing
to him the change of foot on the same spot and in
the same way as when you began by trotting, and you
will no doubt be immediately successful.</p>

<p>If the horse in changing the lead of the fore-feet does
not make the corresponding change with the hind-feet,
he is said to be <i>disunited</i>. This fault must be corrected
immediately, as it renders his gait not only uncomfortable
to the rider, but very insecure.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_II" id="PART_II">PART II.</a><br />
ETIQUETTE IN THE SADDLE.</h2>

<p>There is a large class of excellent people who feel a
decided impatience at the very name of etiquette. “It
is all nonsense,” they say, and they will give you various
infallible receipts for getting on without such an
objectionable article. One admonishes you to be “natural,”
and your manners will leave nothing to be desired.
Another sagaciously defines politeness to be
“kindness kindly expressed,” and intimates that if your
heart is right your deportment cannot fail to be so too.
All these philosophizings, however, give little comfort
to the bashful young person just venturing into society,
for unfortunately few of us are so happily constituted
as always to think, much less to say and do, exactly the
right thing at the right time, and the most unobservant
presently discovers, very likely at the cost of no small
mortification, that the usages of society, even when apparently
arbitrary, cannot be disregarded with impunity.
In the etiquette of the saddle, however, common-sense
takes so decidedly precedence of the arbitrary and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ventional
that no courageous, kind-hearted, and sensible
young girl, however inexperienced, need be afraid of
committing any fatal solecism. The reason of this is
that the element of danger is never entirely absent, and
that the importance of assuring the safety and comfort
of yourself and companions, to say nothing of lookers-on
and passers-by, or of the noble and valuable animal
you ride, far transcends that of observing any mere
forms and ceremonies.</p>

<h3><a id="DRESS" name="DRESS"></a>DRESS.</h3>

<p>Fashion at present, both in this country and in England,
requires that the whole riding costume be as simple
as possible, and entirely without ornament. Formerly
much more latitude was allowed, and very pretty
effects were produced with braid trimming across the
breast, a little color at the neck, and a slouched hat with
long feather or floating veil&mdash;witness the picture of the
Empress Eugénie when Countess Montijo, and many a
charming family portrait besides&mdash;but now fashion pronounces
all that sort of thing “bad form,” and a word
to the wise is sufficient. The habit itself must be quite
dark, or even black, perfectly plain in the waist, with
black buttons up to the neck, and with a scant, short
skirt only just long enough to cover the feet. The
cuffs and collar must be of plain linen, no color or flutter
of ribbon being anywhere permissible. The handkerchief
must not be thrust in the breast, but kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the saddle pocket, and if a veil is worn, it must be short
and black. The hair should be so securely put up that
it will not shake down, and that the hair-pins will not
work out. In the matter of the hat more freedom of
choice is allowed, and in the country almost anything
may be worn, but wherever there is any pretence of
dressing, the only correct thing is the regulation silk
“cylinder,” which, by-the-bye, usually looks better rather
low in the crown, and which is every way a pleasanter
and more serviceable hat than ladies who have never
worn one are apt to imagine. About the cutting of a
riding-habit, it may be remarked, there is nothing mysterious,
although one might think so from the way it is
often talked about, especially in the advertisements of
fashionable tailors, and there is no reason in the world
why any clever young girl should not make one for
herself if she chooses. The only eccentricity about it,
from the dress-making point of view, is the shaping out
of a place for the right knee, so that the skirt may hang
straight and not ruck up, and this can easily be managed
at home by improvising a horse with a couple of chairs
and a rolled-up rug, putting the saddle on it, and trying
the effect in place. Be careful to leave plenty of room
across the breast. A couple of straps should be sewn
inside in the proper place, so that the toe or heel of
each foot may be inserted to prevent the skirt from
rising and exposing the feet; and these straps should
not be strong, but, on the contrary, like all other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the skirt, and particularly the facing, should be made
so as certainly to tear loose instantly in case of getting
caught in a fall. Before leaving the habit, we may remark
that the wearer should practise gathering it up,
holding it in one hand, and walking in it at home, and
if possible before a mirror. No petticoats ought to be
worn, but merino drawers, and easy trousers of the same
stuff as the rest of the habit. Beware of badly made
seams, which have a vexatious way, as many a masculine
wearer can testify, of pinching out a bit of skin at some
inopportune moment. The trousers should be cut away
a little over the instep, and fastened down under the
sole with straps, which may be either sewed on or attached
by buttons inside the band, in which case india-rubber
is the best material, being easy alike on buttons,
stuff, and fingers. Corsets should be worn as usual, but
never laced tight, and it would be better that they
should not have steel clasps or steel springs, which
might be dangerous in case of a fall. The boots should
be easy, broad-soled, low-heeled, and rather laced than
buttoned, as less likely on the one hand to catch in the
stirrup, and on the other to bruise the foot by chafing
against the saddle. The gloves should be strong, but
supple and easy, as it is important that every finger
should have free and independent movement. Tight
gloves not only benumb the hands in cold weather, but
always cause an awkward handling of the reins, and
may be positively dangerous with a fresh horse. As to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the relative merits of crop and whip, there is room for
difference of opinion. By many persons the former is
looked upon as a senseless affectation of English ways,
but the fact is that with a horse regularly trained to the
saddle it is more useful than a whip, as by its aid a lady
can “collect” her horse&mdash;that is, can make him bring
his hind-legs under him, in the same way that a man
does by the pressure of his calves. If, however, the
horse has never been trained, and is sluggish or wilful,
a whip may be more useful. Whichever of the two
produces the better results will have the more “workmanlike”
look and be in the “better form.”</p>

<h3><a id="THE_MOUNT" name="THE_MOUNT"></a>THE MOUNT.</h3>

<p>It is undoubtedly much pleasanter and more exhilarating
to ride a good and handsome horse than a poor
and ugly one, a horse adapted to one’s size and weight
than one too large or too small, too heavy or too light;
but none of these points are matters of etiquette. On
this whole subject etiquette makes only one demand,
but that one is inexorable&mdash;it is <i>perfect neatness</i>. A
lady’s mount must be immaculate from ear to hoof, in
coat and mane and entire equipment. It is in a great
degree their exquisite neatness that gives such an air of
style not only to English horsewomen, but to English
turn-outs of all kinds, which, nevertheless, have not
usually the “spick and span new” look of fashionable
American equipages. On coming out, therefore, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>pared
for a ride, take time to look your horse over swiftly,
but keenly, noting first that his eye and general appearance
indicate good health and spirits; secondly, that
he has been thoroughly groomed, his mane freed from
dandruff, his hoofs washed, but not blacked; thirdly,
that the saddle and bridle are perfectly clean and properly
put on. Every buckle should have been undone
and cleansed, the leather suppled, and the bright metal
polished; the girths, three in number&mdash;never fewer
than two&mdash;should be snug, but not tight enough to impede
free breathing; the bits in their proper place, that
is to say, the snaffle just high enough up not to wrinkle
the corners of the mouth, and the curb considerably
lower, with its chain, which should pass below the snaffle,
lying flat and smooth against the skin in the chin
groove; finally, the throat-latch loose. While it is not
always wise to reprimand carelessness on the part of
your groom on the spot, it is well never to let it pass
unnoticed, while, on the other hand, it is a good plan
always to show appreciation of especial attention to
your wishes by a kind word or a smile.</p>

<h3><a id="MOUNTING" name="MOUNTING"></a>MOUNTING.</h3>

<p>It is rather a trying ordeal for an inexperienced rider
to mount a tall horse from the ground, even when there
are no lookers-on, and many a one remains in bondage
to chairs and horse-blocks all her life long rather than
undertake it. The feat, however, is really so much ea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>sier
than it looks, and when well performed makes the
rider appear so agile and graceful, giving such an air of
style and <i>savoir-faire</i> to the departure, that it is well
worth every lady’s while to acquire it. The first requisite
is that the horse should stand still, and for this purpose
the attendant should have given him some preliminary
exercise, as the fresh air and bright light are so
exhilarating to a high-strung horse that he cannot at
first restrain his impulse to caper about. This preparatory
airing should be entered upon invariably as calmly
as possible, and begun at a walk, for a flurry at starting,
and especially the use of the whip, will often disturb a
horse’s nerves for hours, making him unpleasant if not
dangerous to ride. When the horse is brought to the
door, let the groom stand directly in front of him, holding
the bridle not by the rein, but with both hands by
each cheek, just above the bit. If he is a proud and
sensitive animal, do not rush up to him excitedly with
a slamming of doors and gates, nor allow any one else
to do so, but approach with gentle steadiness. Stand a
moment and look him over, give your orders quietly, and
pat his neck for a moment, speaking pleasantly to him
the while, so that he may get accustomed to your voice.</p>

<p class="caption">READY TO MOUNT.</p>
</div>

<p>Now standing with your right side a few inches from
the saddle, facing the same way as the horse, and with
your left shoulder slightly thrown back, place the right
hand on the second pommel, holding in it the whip, and
the reins drawn just tight enough to give a feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the bit. Your attendant will stand facing you, and as
close as convenient, and will now stoop forward, with
his hands clasped and with his right forearm firmly supported
on his right thigh. Now with your left hand
lift your riding-skirt in front, and place your left foot
in his hands. Let go the skirt, rest your left hand on
his shoulder, and giving him the cue by bending the
right knee, spring up erect on the left foot, and, seating
yourself sideways on the saddle, place the right knee
over the horn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">“ONE, TWO, THREE.”</p>
</div>

<p>If your attendant is unused to rendering such service,
you had better make your first essays in some secluded
place, in which you can instruct him where to stand,
just how high to lift your foot, and caution him to put
forth strength enough to support you steadily, without
lifting too violently. Do not be deterred by awkwardness
on his part or on your own from learning to mount
from the ground, for the more awkward, the better practice
for you. Your attendant will now lift your skirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
above the knee, so that it will hang properly without
dragging, and then disengaging the stirrup from beneath
the skirt, will place your left foot in it.</p>

<div class="center">
<a id="Illus_31" name="Illus_31"></a><img src="images/illus-096.png" width="489" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLACING THE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP.</p>
</div>

<p>Too much care cannot be taken with the position in
the saddle, which should be exactly as shown in the following
cut. The left leg should invariably hang perpendicularly
from the knee, with the heel depressed,
and with the foot parallel with the horse’s side. The
length of the stirrup-strap should be such that the knee
thus is out of contact with the hunting-horn, but near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
enough to be brought firmly up against it by raising the
heel. The right knee should rest easily but snugly over
the pommel, so as to grasp it in case the horse springs.
Neither foot should be allowed to sway about nor to
project so as to be seen awkwardly poking out the skirt.
If your clothing does not feel quite comfortable, rise in
your stirrup and shake it down, resting your hand, if
necessary, on your attendant’s shoulder, for it will be
very awkward should it become disarranged on the road.
Now put your handkerchief in the saddle pocket, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the reins in the left hand, or in both hands, as you prefer,
and start the horse by a touch with the heel.</p>

<div class="center">
<a id="Illus_32" name="Illus_32"></a><img src="images/illus-097.png" width="514" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">POSITION IN SADDLE.</p>
</div>

<p>It is, of course, the correct thing to mount from the
ground, if possible, but here again common-sense comes
so decidedly to the front that it is not too much to say
that the sole indispensable requirement of an enlightened
etiquette is <i>good-nature</i>. Certain it is that the eye
masculine will follow with pleasure, and perhaps with
some emotion, the movements of the young girl who
comes out bright and fresh, gives her horse a pat or two,
with a lump of sugar, as she glances him quickly over,
looks kindly at her stable-boy, and then skips gayly into
the saddle from a chair brought out by a maid, while
the same eye will rest quite unmoved, except by a spirit
of criticism, on the self-conscious and selfish damsel,
though she be put on in the most approved manner by
the smartest groom who ever wore top-boots. Mount,
then, from the ground, if you have some one to put you
on and some one to hold your horse; or, if the horse
will stand without holding, cautioning your escort&mdash;if
you are not sure of his expertness in such services&mdash;to
be sure to raise your foot straight up, and to give you
warning by counting one, two, so that you may be certain
to have the leg straightened before he begins to
lift, as otherwise the result may be the reverse of graceful.
When in the saddle, rise in your stirrup, as already
suggested, and smooth down your dress, meantime thanking
your escort and telling him how well he did it. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
smoothing down of the skirt it is a good plan to practise
frequently, first standing, then at a walk, then at a trot,
till you can do it deftly, almost without thought, for
there is no telling at what inopportune moment it may
become necessary.</p>

<p>To mount from the ground without assistance is a
feat which few ladies would voluntarily undertake. It
may be accomplished in an emergency, however, if the
horse is quiet and not too tall, by lowering the stirrup
sufficiently to reach it with the left foot, and springing
up with the aid of the hands, the left of which should
grasp the mane and the right the cantle of the saddle.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_START" name="THE_START"></a>THE START.</h3>

<p>Do not put your horse in motion by a cut with the
whip, which would be trying to his nerves, nor by chirping
or clucking, which would be equally trying to the
nerves of your companions, but by a touch with the
heel, or a pressure between your heel on the left side
and your crop on the right. If other ladies are to be
mounted, move on so far that they will be in no danger,
either real or imaginary, from your horse’s heels, and
never at any time put him in such a position that he
can kick any one, or that you can get kicked yourself
by any other horse. If you have to turn about on starting,
try to do so by making your horse step around with
his hind-legs (in the technical phrase, <i>pirouette renversée</i>),
so as to avoid turning your back and presenting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
haunches towards any one with whom you may be talking
or from whom you are to take leave. To be able
to do this easily and gracefully you must have him well
“collected” and “light in hand.”</p>

<h3><a id="ON_WHICH_SIDE_TO_RIDE" name="ON_WHICH_SIDE_TO_RIDE"></a>ON WHICH SIDE TO RIDE.</h3>

<p>The next question that arises is on which side of her
escort a lady should ride. This point, so much discussed
and disputed in this country, is scarcely raised in England,
where the universal habit of turning to the left
makes it, under almost all circumstances, safer for her
to be on his left, in which position he finds himself always
interposed between his charge and any passing
vehicle, whether it come from before or from behind.
In this country, however, we have adopted&mdash;nobody
knows why, unless it is because the French do so&mdash;the
rule of keeping to the right, and yet without changing
our manner of riding and driving, so that the result is
often awkward and even dangerous. The teamster who
used to walk on the left of his horses, so as to lead them
out of the way when occasion required, still walks on
the left, which now puts him in the middle of the road;
the coachman still sits on the right, though the probability
of contact has changed over to the other side; the
lady’s seat is still on the left side of the horse, which
obliges her to choose between the danger of being
caught by passing wheels or crushed by the horse of
her escort. As there is no reason in the world, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
in the conformation of the female form or of the horse
itself, or in the exigencies of equestrianism, that makes
it inherently more proper to sit on one side of the horse
rather than on the other, it seems strange that none of
our independent American ladies should have undertaken
to set the fashion of sitting on the right side.
The Princess of Wales always does so, for some special
reason. The Empress of Austria, who is well known as
one of the boldest and most graceful riders as well as
one of the most beautiful women in Europe, is said to
have saddles made in both ways, using them alternately,
and this plan is adopted by more than one of the noble
ladies of England who hunt regularly in the season,
with a view of preventing too constant a strain on the
same set of nerves, and possibly causing an unequal development
of the two sides of the person. However,
accepting the present feminine seat as a thing not to be
changed, the advantages in this country of riding on the
one hand of the escort or on the other are so equally
divided that the balance may incline to either side, and
a lady is always free to do about it as she pleases without
exciting remark. When riding on the right side,
the lady is protected from passing vehicles, and the gentleman
has his right hand free to assist her in any way,
even to taking her off her horse in case of necessity;
but if either horse were to shy towards the other, she
might get bruised, and she is always liable to an occasional
contact with her companion’s person, which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
not be pleasant. Children should certainly be kept on
the right, and so should any inexperienced or very timid
person; and at all times a gentleman should interpose
himself between the lady under his charge and danger
of any kind&mdash;as, for instance, reckless drivers, rude
strollers, or a drove of cattle. When riding on the left,
the lady is undoubtedly in a more exposed position, especially
if her horse is disposed to dance or shy at rattling
wagons and the like; but her escort, being able to
ride closer to her, is enabled more quickly and safely to
take the animal by the head, if necessary, and under all
circumstances he should hold his reins and whip in his
right hand, and in case of danger keep his horse well
“collected,” so as to be ready to act promptly and without
any show of excitement.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_SEAT" name="THE_SEAT"></a>THE SEAT.</h3>

<p><i>Position.</i>&mdash;The lady’s position on horseback is so conspicuous
that the fact ought to stimulate the most indifferent
so to place and carry herself as to show her figure
to the best advantage, and this graceful carriage of the
person will be found to be the first step towards achieving
a firm and easy seat. The posture should be erect,
the back slightly hollowed, the breast thrown forward,
the chin drawn in so that the neck will be nearly vertical.
The lower limbs should rest easily but firmly in
their respective places, the left leg hanging perpendicularly
from the knee downward, with heel slightly de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>pressed,
and foot parallel with the horse’s side, the right
toe raised a little
above the horizontal,
but not carried
far enough forward
to poke up the riding
habit. The seat
should be in the middle
of the saddle,
not on the right side
of it with the body
inclined to the left,
which is excessively
awkward, nor on the
left side with an inclination
to the right,
which is equally awkward,
and with the
additional disadvantage
of being sure
to cause saddle galls.
When the body is
consciously <i>balanced</i>
on the horse’s back,
when the shoulders
are equidistant from
his ears, and when
the eyes, looking be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tween
said ears (an excellent habit), look straight along
the road, and not off obliquely to one side of it, then
the seat, whatever else it may not be, is at least in the
middle of the saddle.</p>

<p class="caption">A SQUARE AND PROPER SEAT.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Hand.</i>&mdash;As to the manner of carrying the arms,
Colonel Hayes remarks that he has seen of late (in England)
some ladies sticking out their elbows, but that he,
for his part, decidedly approves of the old rule which
forbade that daylight should be seen between a lady’s
arms and body. The sight which annoyed Colonel
Hayes is not unknown in America, but probably most
observers correctly attribute it either to ignorance or
affectation. Certainly there is no reason for it, whether
practical or æsthetic, as the raising of the elbows lifts
the hands into a position in which the reins act less
correctly on the horse’s mouth, while substituting angles
for curves in the outline of the figure, and quite destroying
the air of well-bred repose which is one of the
great charms of a finished horsewoman. The arms
should hang naturally by the sides, with the hands, a
few inches apart, just above the knee, and as low as possible
without resting on it, the nails turned down, the
knuckles at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon,
the wrists bent inward so as to permit of a little play
of the wrist joint at each tug of the horse on the reins.</p>

<p><i>The Poise.</i>&mdash;All this is not very difficult so long as
the horse keeps quiet, or even when he merely walks;
but how is this much-admired statuesque repose to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
preserved at the trot, the canter, the gallop, to say nothing
of incidental shying and capering? There is only
one answer to this question, and that is&mdash;<i>practice</i>. But
even practice is usually not sufficient without an accompaniment,
infrequent and not always pleasant, <i>viz.</i>,
frank and unflattering criticism; and every one who
really wishes to excel, and to merit the praises which as
woman she is certain to receive, will see to it that this
wholesome corrective is often at hand. Practice itself,
to be profitable, must be intelligent, and the cause of
any discomfort from the motion of the horse should be
sought out and removed. It will be found almost always
to result from involuntary muscular contractions,
especially of the waist, which should invariably be kept
supple, as it is to a slight play of loin and thigh that
the rider must look to prevent being thrown up by each
spring of the hind-legs in cantering or galloping.</p>

<p>In rising to the trot, bear outwardly with the left
heel, which will keep the knee close against the saddle,
and prevent the leg from swaying about. At the same
time be careful not to rise towards the left&mdash;an awkward
but very common habit, which can be detected by the
plan already suggested of sighting between the horse’s
ears. Mr. Sidney says, “The ideal of a fine horsewoman
is to be erect without being rigid, square to the
front, and until quite at home in the saddle, looking
religiously between her horse’s ears. The shoulders
must therefore be square, but thrown back a little, so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to expand the chest and make a hollow waist, such as
is observed in waltzing, but always flexible. On the
flexibility of the person above the waist, and on the
firmness below, all the grace of equestrianism, all the
safety, depend. Nervousness makes both men and
women poke their heads forward&mdash;a stupid trick in a
man, unpardonable in a woman. A lady should bend
like a willow in a storm, always returning to an easy
and nearly upright position. Nothing but practice&mdash;frequent,
but not too long continued&mdash;can establish the
all-important balance. Practice, and practice only, enables
the rider instinctively to bear to the proper side,
or lean back, as a horse turns, bounds, or leaps.” It is
evidently not simply pounding along the high-road
in a straight line on a steady nag which is here meant.
The following advice, given by a lady who is herself
an accomplished horsewoman, will furnish a clew to the
sort of exercise which will be really profitable. She
says, “Let the pupil practise riding in circles to the
right, sitting upright, but bending a little to the horse’s
motion, following his nose with her eye; beginning
with a walk, proceed to a slow trot, increasing the action
as she gains firmness in the saddle. When in a smart
trot on a circle to the right she can, leaning as she
should to the right, see the feet of the horse on the
right side, it may be assumed that she has arrived at a
firm seat.” Another excellent exercise is to lean over,
now to one side, now to the other, now in front, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
enough to observe the horse’s action, the motion of his
feet, and the regularity of his step.</p>

<h3><a id="ON_THE_ROAD" name="ON_THE_ROAD"></a>ON THE ROAD.</h3>

<p>If good-nature is the quality most essential to <i>mounting</i>
in a pleasing manner, that which will cause a lady
to shine most <i>on the road</i> is kindness. Such a statement
will perhaps bring a smile to the lips of some
dashing girl who thinks that she has other means of
pleasing, once mounted on a spirited horse, than the
practice of any of the Christian virtues; but the writer,
after many years’ experience with <i>amazones</i> both young
and old, believes it to be literally true. A lady who,
without weakness, is gentle and thoughtful, will have,
other things being equal, more sympathetic obedience
from her horse, a finer hand, a more supple seat, and
will bring him back fresher and her whole party home
in better spirits than one who is not. To begin with,
there is almost always one of the horses which is not
equal to the others, but keeps up with difficulty, and as
it is precisely that horse which should set the pace for
the rest, it is well to observe the capacity of the different
animals, and spare the feelings of any one of the
party who may be poorly mounted. One might hardly
suppose it necessary to mention so elementary a rule of
politeness as that which bids us, when we ride in company,
not to keep always in the best part of the road;
but horses are sometimes selfish as well as human be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ings,
and the selfish horse, like the selfish man, unless
he is prevented, will imperceptibly crowd his patient
companion into the ruts, when the rider will get the
credit or discredit of the action. Another too common
piece of thoughtlessness is the splashing at full speed
through mud puddles, the result of which is naturally
more apparent to one’s neighbors than to one’s self. If
to an equestrian, however, being splashed or spattered
is annoying, to a pedestrian it is nothing less than exasperating,
and such a one will look after the person
guilty of the rudeness with eyes of anything but admiration.
One cannot be too careful, indeed, when riding
near pedestrians, as they are decidedly susceptible under
such circumstances, and likely to take offence; and especially
is caution required where women and children
are concerned, for it is impossible to conjecture what
they will do if suddenly startled by the rapid approach
of horses. The writer saw, one afternoon, a nursery-maid
crossing Rotten Row with a baby-carriage (<i>Anglice,
perambulator</i>), and two children holding to her
skirts. When half-way over, a lady and three gentlemen
came galloping down, followed by two grooms.
The children scattered, the riders could not pull up, and
for an instant it seemed as if the little party were
doomed to destruction, as the horses appeared to pass
right over some of them. The English rule, not only
for country riding, but for the Park or other public
places (and an excellent one it is), requires a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to pull up and pass a lady, if alone, at a walk, whether
she be on foot or on horseback, and though more latitude
may be allowed a lady, yet she should not gallop
up suddenly behind another lady who is alone, as a
nervous horse might be so excited as to cause great uneasiness
to a timid rider. If you should unfortunately
produce such a result, by all means pause and express
regret, and if your horse is quiet, offer to ride for a few
minutes beside the sufferer&mdash;for so she may be called.
In passing on the road, the rule is, when meeting, to
keep to the right, but when overtaking, to pass to the
left, and in like manner, when overtaken, to keep to the
right, so as to leave the road free at your left. The
only exception to this rule is in the case of led-horses,
which, as they are often inclined to kick, should be
avoided by passing next to the one ridden. When approaching
a lady in a public place a gentleman should
always do so on the off or right side.</p>

<p>It is sometimes rather a nice point to decide when
assistance ought to be offered by a gentleman to a lady
with whom he is not acquainted, and, if offered, whether
it ought to be accepted. The following incident, recounted
by Sir Joseph Arnould in his “Life of Lord
Chief-justice Denman,” is interesting as showing how
such a question was discussed in what may certainly be
considered as among the very best society in England.
He says that on occasion of a visit which the Lord Chief-justice
paid to Walmer Castle, three years before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Duke of Wellington’s death, in a conversation about
riding, the duke said, “When I meet a lady on horseback
I always stop, and if her horse seems troublesome,
offer to ride alongside her in the Row till it is quiet.
The other day I met a lady on a fresh, violent horse, so
I took off my hat and said, ‘Shall I ride with you?
My horse is perfectly quiet.’ She knew me, for she replied,
‘No, your Grace; I think I can get on very well.’
After she was gone, I felt sure it was Jenny Lind.”
“We all agreed,” adds Lord Denman, “that the great
singer should have accepted the services of the great
duke, whether she wanted them or not.”</p>

<p>It is better not to fight a restive horse unless you
have reason to be sure of victory, but rather get some
one to lead him past the object or into the road which
he may have taken it into his foolish head to object to.
If he is in “that state of nervous irritability known as
<i>freshness</i>” do not jerk the bit, but keep a steady, patient
bearing on it, speaking soothingly to him in a low
though steady voice, for his acute hearing will enable
him to perceive distinctly tones which are almost or
quite inaudible to your companions. Try not to have
an anxious expression of countenance, no matter what
he may do, but to look serene and smiling, as it will not
only be more becoming, but will undoubtedly react upon
your own feelings. If he pulls, it is well to take the
slack of the right reins in the spare fingers of the left,
and <i>vice versa</i>, as this will give a firmer hold, and en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>able
you to shorten the reins without relaxing their
tension.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">METHOD OF HOLDING THE REINS IN BOTH HANDS.</p>
</div>

<p>Always speak to your horse on approaching and on
leaving him, and also whenever he has tried especially
to please you, as your voice will soon come to have a
great influence over him. There is a story told of two
keepers in a zoological garden, one of whom was a favorite
with the animals, while the other, though a more conscientious
man, was disliked by them. The authorities,
curious to learn the reason, had them watched, and it
was found that the former always talked to the animals,
while the latter served them silently. Too much con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>versation
with one’s horse, however, is apt to get to be
a bore to one’s companions.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_PACE" name="THE_PACE"></a>THE PACE.</h3>

<p>This should vary with the nature of the ground, as it
is dangerous to the horse, and consequently very bad
form, to ride fast on a very rough or hard road. If
slippery, a smart trot is safer than a slow trot or walk;
but if walking, by all means let the horse have his
head. If a steep place is to be descended, attack it at
right angles, and not obliquely, for, when going down
straight, a slip is likely to have no worse result than a
momentary sitting down on the haunches, whereas, if
going diagonally, it would probably bring the horse
down flat. The canter, which is peculiarly the lady’s
pace, is much harder than the trot on the horse’s feet
and legs, especially on the leading foot and leg, and it
should be reserved for comparatively soft ground. The
lead with the right foot is easier for a lady, owing to
her one-sided seat, than that with the left, and it would
be considered awkward or ignorant for her not to start
off with the right, although during a long ride it is well
to change, so as to bring the strain upon a new set of
muscles.</p>

<h3><a id="TURNING" name="TURNING"></a>TURNING.</h3>

<p>Of course in turning you must always lead towards
the turn, that is, with the right foot in turning to the
right, and with the left in turning to the left. For in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>stance,
if you have to round a corner to the right, and
are leading with the right foot, as will probably be the
case, you have nothing to do but to go on around, being
careful to choose good footing for your horse, and
avoiding particularly loose stones. If, however, you
are leading with the left, you must change, and you can
best do so in the following manner. As you approach
the critical spot, <i>collect</i> your horse with the curb, and
bring him to a trot; then, just as you reach the corner,
make him swerve slightly to the left and instantly give
the signal to canter, at the same time turning him
sharply to the right, pressing your heel against his side
back of the girth, and lifting the right snaffle-rein. It
is well to draw back the right shoulder also, so as to
throw your weight on his left side, and leave his right
leg free to make the long stride. As this is by no
means an easy operation for an unskilled rider, except
on a perfectly trained horse, I will give the directions
also in detail for the reverse process of wheeling to the
left. If your horse should be leading with the left foot,
you have, of course, no change to make. If, however,
you are, as usual, leading with the right, you must
“change the leg” to the left. As you draw near the
corner, moderate your speed and collect your horse with
the curb, bringing him to a trot. Then, just at the moment
of turning, sway his shoulders a very little to the
right, give the signal to canter by raising your hand,
and wheel sharply to the left, at the same time pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
your crop against his right side back of the girth, and
raising the left snaffle-rein. While doing so, draw back
your left shoulder so as to throw your weight on the
right side. If he does not take the hint at once, do not
be discouraged, but practise him in some quiet place,
choosing, if possible, a corner where the turn is uphill;
and when he does well, pat him and make much of
him, for you will find that no one of your admirers is
more sensitive to your praises than he. This matter of
turning is well worth all the trouble it may cost you, as
it will give you a lively pleasure to find your horse’s
powerful limbs moving sympathetically to the gentle
impulses of a woman’s hand, and, besides, it lends an
air of style and <i>savoir-faire</i> which will be fully appreciated
by every looker-on who knows anything whatever
about riding. Be particular to lean over towards
the centre of the curve you are describing at an angle
proportionate to the speed, just as the horse does himself,
that is, leaning to the right side as he wheels to
the right, and to the left when he wheels to the left.
It is well not to let him cut off his corners, but to preserve
the same distance from the centre of the road,
just as if you were riding in company, and when this
last is the case be careful to keep exactly abreast both
on the straight road and on the turns, for there is nothing
that looks more countrified than to see riders straggling
along irregularly like a party of mechanics out for
a stroll on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well never to canter a carriage-horse unless you
know him well, and are sure he will not thus be rendered
unsteady in harness, and in like manner you should
be considerate of your escort or companions, and not
urge their horses beyond their proper gait. A good
way to do, if you are much the best mounted of the
party, is now and then, when the road is suitable, to
gallop on and return again. It looks well to see a lady
cantering beside a gentleman who is trotting; but the
reverse never seems quite good form, and especially
when it is evident that the gentleman’s horse is galloping
because he has been pushed off his legs.</p>

<p>A borrowed horse is an article which is looked upon
with very different eyes by the elderly people who generally
are the lenders, and the youthful riders that are
usually the borrowers, and many a man, and perhaps
many a woman too, remembers with shame and regret
how little were appreciated or deserved the favors of
this sort received in youthful days. A borrowed horse
should be scrupulously ridden exactly as the owner
wishes, and moreover the owner’s desires ought to be
respectfully ascertained in advance.</p>

<p>For cross-country riding the stirrups should be taken
up at least one hole, and the same is advisable in mounting
a strange horse. Another safe precaution, in the
latter case, is a running martingale, which will prevent
him from throwing up his head, as some horses have
the habit of doing, to the great annoyance of the rider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two or three more practical suggestions
which may not be out of place here. The first and
most important is that it is exceedingly dangerous to
let a horse stand in a draught of air, or in a cool place,
or eat or drink, when heated. In ten minutes he may
be so crippled that he will never take a free step again.
Ferry-boats are notoriously bad places, and a horse
should never be taken on to them till quite cool. It is
not well to let your horse crop the leaves or grass, as
kind-hearted riders permit him to do sometimes, for it
soils his lips and bits, giving him a slovenly air, and you
run the risk besides of his wiping them on your habit
before you part from him. Avoid letting your horse
drink unless he really would be better for the refreshment,
as he can hardly do so without wetting the curb-reins,
making them stiff and dirty-looking.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_GROOM" name="THE_GROOM"></a>THE GROOM.</h3>

<p>The costume of the groom is too well known to require
remark further than that it should be scrupulously
neat. In the country, top-boots, etc., are by no means
<i>de rigueur</i>, and under many circumstances would savor
more of pretence than of real gentility. The groom
ought to be mounted on a strong and able horse, which,
if unused to the saddle, he should train at least so far
that he can with one hand, by the aid of his legs, force
it to take and keep any position. When accompanying
inexperienced riders his horse should be able to over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>take
theirs easily. The distance at which he should
ride behind his mistress varies with circumstances&mdash;in
a crowded street his place being close behind her, while
in the Park or in the country he naturally falls farther
back, though never beyond easy call. If he is mounted
on a good saddle-horse, he should keep in his place, that
is, always at the same distance, galloping if necessary;
but if riding a carriage-horse, as is often convenient, he
should not, unless absolutely necessary, force the animal
beyond the fastest trot at which it looks well in
harness. He should never canter any horse unless instructed
expressly to do so, but should trot in a business-like
way, rising in his stirrups, or, if necessary,
should gallop, sitting straight, with hands low and feet
thrust home in the stirrups. In all cases he should look
straight forward, without appearing to notice what goes
on around him. Nothing looks in worse form than a
groom sitting lazily back on a cantering horse, and casting
glances at the admiring nursery-maids along the
way. When summoned to his mistress, he should touch
his hat to acknowledge receipt of the command, and
should ride quickly up on the off side, where he should
listen in a respectful attitude with eyes cast down, then,
touching his hat again, depart to carry out her orders.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III">PART III.</a><br />
LEAPING.</h2>

<p>One pleasant winter afternoon a fashionably dressed
young man, crop in hand, spur on heel, and mounted
on a tall horse, was seen to emerge briskly from a little
grove in a gentleman’s place, and come to a sudden halt
in the level field across which he had intended to gallop.
The cause was a new ditch, deep though narrow, stretching
across from fence to fence before him. He looked
at the obstacle a moment, then up and down the field,
and remarked to a gardener, an old Scotchman, who
stood looking on, spade in hand, “Well, I suppose I
must go back.” “I suppose so,” said the old fellow,
dryly, looking up out of the corner of his eye with an
almost imperceptible smile. The young man reddened,
hesitated, and then turned away, saying, as if the other’s
thoughts had been spoken out, “To tell the truth, I
don’t know whether my horse would if he could, nor
whether he could if he would.” “An’ the same o’
yourself,” muttered the old man in his grizzled beard.
The sarcasm was not to be wondered at, as the speaker
remembered what he had many a time seen, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
likely himself done in his younger days in some hunting
field of the old country, for the ditch before him
could have been cleared by an active boy, on his own
legs, with a good run. Moreover, it is not improbable
that the reader is ready to agree with the old satirist in
thinking the young man a “muff.” Nevertheless, both
horse and rider might easily have come to grief, for the
steep banks were crumbly, and while the rider’s seat
was not of the firmest, his mount was straight in the
shoulder and a little stiff in the pastern. However,
they were both as well fitted to overcome such a difficulty
as nine-tenths of American horses and riders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
a very little previous practice would have enabled them
to spring over without bestowing a second thought upon
it. The total indifference on this subject of leaping
among our people is really quite remarkable, for one
can hardly take a ride anywhere in the country without
there arising some occasions when even a little
knowledge of the art would have added to one’s pleasure.
How often, for instance, an easy fence separates
the dusty road, too hard as well as too hot for fast riding,
from some cool wood with its shaded turf, where a
gallop would be delightful and would do the horse good
instead of harm. The reason of this indifference is not
only the fear of getting shaken off, but a doubt as to
the horse’s ability to leap, and a dread of doing him
some harm by such an unusual exertion. All these
apprehensions are very likely well-founded, for if you
have never done any leaping your first essay will, in all
probability, give you a severe shock. Then if your
horse is green at this sort of work, and the fence is at
all difficult, he will not improbably refuse altogether, or
jump so unwillingly and clumsily as to risk your bones
as well as his own; and if he does not really fall, he
may cause such a strain upon unaccustomed muscles as
to set up a “splint” or “spavin,” producing at least
temporary lameness. Nevertheless, all these excellent
reasons for not trying to leap can gradually, but rapidly
and with perfect safety, be removed by practice, and
practice of a kind very pleasant and interesting, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
at the same time improving to your seat, giving it a
firmness under all circumstances which no amount of

<p class="caption">APPROACHING A FENCE.</p>
</div>

<p>Some horses are exceedingly fond of leaping, but the
majority are indifferent, though on the whole rather
averse to it, while a few positively will not try at all.
The first thing to be done is to get your horse to take
low and easy leaps without repugnance. For this purpose
lay the bar you intend to use on the ground, and
lead him over it without looking back at him or giving
him any reason to suppose that you have any particular
object in so doing. Should he object to stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
over it, be patient though firm, and when he has finally
done so, pat and praise him; but if he has been bred in
this country, and is used to bar places, he will probably
give no trouble at this stage of his education. Now
mount him and repeat the operation; then, having the
bar raised a few inches, do so again, and continue doing
so, always at a walk, until it is so high that he can no
longer step over it. American horses are famous for
their excellent tempers; nevertheless, at this point, unless
you manage with care and with a judicious reference
to equine peculiarities of mind and temper, you
may meet with a refusal to proceed. In this event you
must not use force or severity, or you may disgust the
horse, perhaps forever, with the very exercise you wish
him to learn to enjoy, but must content yourself with
preventing him from sheering off and keeping him
facing his task till, sooner or later, he will go over.
Now praise him and make much of him, and ask no
more jumping till the next lesson. It is not a good
plan to put the bar up in an open place, for the horse
will think it nonsense, and unless he is unusually docile
will resent what will seem to him to be an imposition
in forcing him to jump over it when he could easily go
around it. A bar place or gate-way is much better, as
it cannot be “flanked,” and he will not wonder at being
asked to go through it, but he should never be ridden
backward and forward over the bar, nor allowed to see
it raised, but should be brought around to it by a circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
which, if possible, should be large enough to make him
forget the leaping, or think of it only as an accidental
episode in the ride. The ground also should be no
harder than good firm turf. Let him jump towards his
stable or towards home by preference, and it will be well
to let your assistant hold some little article of food which
he is especially fond of in view just beyond the bar, so
that his attention may be distracted from the effort,
while an agreeable association is given him with it, and
he is prevented from thinking that the obstacle is one
of your making. Bear in mind that your object at
present is threefold: to induce him to take a liking for
the new exercise; to give him ease and confidence in
the performance of it; and to train and strengthen by
use the muscles brought into play, so that none of the
unpleasant results mentioned above may follow. Therefore
do not for a considerable time set the bar more
than two feet high, but practise him at it several times
a day; first, as already said, at a walk, then at a slow
trot, and then at a canter, making him lead first with
one foot, then with the other, until he not only springs
over without touching and without apparently thinking
anything about it, but shows by his lengthening or
shortening his stride on approaching, so as to “take off”
at the right distance, that his eye is becoming educated;
and, finally, until a careful daily inspection of his feet
and legs has proved that no soreness or tenderness anywhere
is caused by this exercise. If he does not jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
clean, but knocks the bar with his feet, it may be because
he underestimates the height, as not only horses
but men too are apt to do in the case of open fences
made with posts and rails; therefore have a broad piece
of board, two feet long, stood up against the bar like a
post, and make him leap over it. If he still strikes, it
will be well to try the plan which M. Baucher so enthusiastically
recommends for all horses, and which consists
in raising the bar a little just as the horse is in the
act of springing.</p>

<p class="caption">A WATER JUMP.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be interesting to hear exactly what so great
an authority has to say on this subject. After remarking
that the bar should not be covered with anything to
diminish its hardness, he proceeds: “I let two men
hold the bare bar at six inches above the ground. The
rider advances towards it at a walk, and at the moment
when the horse, aided by the rider, takes the leap, the
two men <i>raise the bar six inches</i>.” The horse naturally
strikes his feet against it. “I make him begin again,
until he clears the bar without touching, notwithstanding
the repeated raising of it at each leap. Then I have
the bar held at a foot above the ground, and, as before,
it will be raised six inches at the moment of the leap.
When the horse is accustomed to clear this new elevation,
I have the bar gradually held six inches higher,
still continuing to raise it six inches at each leap, and I
thus succeed, after a few lessons given with the regular
progression above described, in making all horses jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
obstacles of a height that they would otherwise never
have been able to clear. This simple proceeding, well
applied, will be useful even to exceptional horses, such
as steeple-chasers, by teaching them to come more carefully
to the point of ‘taking off,’ and will render falls
less frequent.” The idea of M. Baucher is to get the
horse in the habit of jumping a little higher than he
thinks necessary, so as to be on the safe side, and a very
good idea it is. It is a practice among experienced riders
to hounds in England, instead of leaping a post-and-rail
fence midway between the posts, to leap as close to
a post as possible, or directly over it when it is not
much higher than the rail.</p>

<p>To return to our equine scholar, having practised
him for a month or so at an elevation of two feet, his
muscles will have adapted themselves to the new strain
put upon them, and it will be safe to begin to raise the
bar higher, and gradually to go up nearly to the limit
of his ability. It is well, however, never to ask too
much, as even a willing leaper will be sometimes so disgusted
at what he thinks tyrannical exactions as to refuse
obstinately ever to try again. The horse should
never be allowed to rush at the bar, but should always,
if approaching at a gallop, be collected, as much as a
hundred feet away, so as to be under perfect control.
The higher the leap, the slower the pace at which it
should be taken, for the very momentum acquired by a
rush, which would be useful in a water leap, would carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the animal against the bar instead of over it. The reins
should be held in both hands, and after the horse has
been collected with the curb, as may very likely be necessary,
the curb should be relaxed, so that on approaching
the leap he may feel only the gentle pressure of the
snaffle, which will not make him fear to thrust forward
his head, a fear which would possibly result in bringing
him down on all fours at once, or even with the hind-feet
first. As he rises to his leap, keep a steady but very
gentle tension on the reins, being ready to support him
firmly as his fore-feet touch the earth.</p>

<p>It is now time to experiment with low stone walls
and with brooks, being always on your guard against
those concealed man-traps in the shape of loose stones,
which form one of the chief dangers of leaping in this
country.</p>

<p class="caption">RISING TO THE LEAP.</p>
</div>

<p>All this while we have been assuming the rider to be
an accomplished horsewoman, and quite <i>au fait</i> at her
fences. If, however, the business is entirely new to her,
let her not be at all disheartened, for her own education
can be carried on simultaneously with that of the horse,
and without the least detriment to it. In this case,
keep to the standing leap&mdash;that is, the leap taken from
a walk&mdash;although it is really the most difficult to sit,
until you can support the unusual motion without being
in the least loosened in the saddle, and do not try
the higher ones till you are perfect in the lower. The
hands should be held as low as possible above the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a><br /><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
knee, and pretty close to the body, so that they may
have room to yield, and that the sudden thrusting out
of the horse’s head may not jerk you forward in the
saddle, in which case the powerful impulsion of the
hind-legs might pitch you out altogether. The advice
is often given in books to lean forward and then backward
in the leap, but the fact is that beginners, if they
lean forward intentionally, seldom get back in time to
avoid the shock above alluded to, and teachers, therefore,
as well as friendly <i>coaches</i>, often call out “lean
back” as a lady nears the bar, which results in giving
the learner an awkward though perhaps not unsafe
manner. The fact is that there is no necessity to
try to lean forward, as the rising of the horse will bring
you involuntarily into a position perpendicular to the
ground, while the play of thigh and waist to prevent
being tossed up is of the same kind as that in the
gallop, only proportionately increased, and it will become
instinctive if leaping is begun moderately and
carried on progressively as already recommended. In
coming down you can hardly lean too far back. The
left foot should not be thrust forward, but kept straight,
or drawn a very little back and held close against the
horse’s side; the stirrup, into which the foot is pushed
to the instep, being one or two holes shorter than for
ordinary riding. On approaching the fence, be particular
to do nothing to distract the animal’s attention, as,
for instance, by ejaculations or nervous movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the reins and person; and after the leap do not fail to
reward him by praises and caresses, for it cannot be too
deeply impressed on the mind that he is exceedingly
sensitive to them, and will consider them an ample reward
for his exertion.</p>

<p class="caption">COMING DOWN.</p>
</div>

<p>The object of these instructions being to enable a lady
to master the art of leaping without a regular instructor,
it will not be amiss to sum up the advice already given
at length, in the words of two competent authorities,
“Vieille Moustache” and Mr. Sidney. The former says:</p>

<p>“She should take a firm hold of the upper crutch of
the saddle with the right knee, sit well into the saddle&mdash;not
back of it, because the farther back the greater the
concussion when the horse alights&mdash;put her left foot
well home in the stirrup, and press her left thigh firmly
against the third crutch, while keeping the left knee
flexible; lean slightly forward, avoid stiffening her
waist, in order to throw the upper part of her figure
backward at the right moment to preserve her balance.
The hands must not move except with the body, and
above all no attempt to enliven the horse by jagging
his mouth as he is about to rise&mdash;a pernicious habit,
practised by riders of both sexes who ought to know
better. Reins too short, head too forward, and pace too
violent are the ordinary faults of beginners. Women
have on their saddles a firmer seat for leaping than
men.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney remarks: “A sheep hurdle is quite high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
enough and the trunk of a tree is quite wide enough for
the first steps in leaping. Balance, gripe of the pommels,
and support of the stirrup must be combined; the
seat as near the centre of the horse’s back as the pommels
will permit; the figure erect, not rigid, with the
shoulders back, ready to bend gently backward as the
horse rises in the air&mdash;not leaning forward, twisted over
on the near side, like a popular spirited and absurd picture
(“First at the Fence”), which really shows ‘how
not to do it;’ the snaffle-reins held in both hands, at a
length that will enable the horse fully to extend himself,
and the rider to bear on his mouth as she bends
back over his croup when he is landing. All this time
her eyes should be looking between the horse’s ears, so
as to keep perfectly square in the saddle.”</p>

<p>If the reader carries out the instruction already given
with care, and exercises good sense and judgment, it is
very unlikely that she will have a fall. Should this
happen, however, there are two things to be remembered,
first to get instantly away from the horse by
scrambling or rolling, and secondly to keep hold of the
reins. In any event, the timid may be reassured by
reflecting that a fall is usually without any serious result,
it being by no means as dangerous to come down
with the horse as to be thrown from him.</p>

BUYING A SADDLE-HORSE.</h2>

<p>The opening of the horse-market is not announced
to ladies by cards of invitation, though such an innovation
on the old-fashioned methods might prove a great
success in the hands of a skilful dealer. Nevertheless, as
soon as spring opens, all over the United States, ladies are
“shopping” for horses, but by no means in their usual
jaunty and self-confident way, for their eyes, which do
them such good service at the silk or lace counter, take
on a timid and hesitating expression in the presence of
this unwonted problem. The acquisition of a saddle-horse
by a young girl is usually a long and complicated
operation, in the course of which her hopes are alternately
raised and depressed day by day, to be at last
very likely disappointed altogether. It often begins at
breakfast-time, somewhat in the following fashion:
“Dear papa, don’t you think I might have a saddle-horse
this season? Eleanor B&mdash;&mdash;’s uncle has given her
a beauty, and we could ride together; and you know
that is just the sort of exercise the doctor said would be
good for me.” The father hesitates, and few fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
there are who do not in their hearts long to grant the
request; but he is a very busy man, and does not feel
as if he could take any more cares upon his shoulders;
and very likely he knows little about horses, and really
has not the slightest idea how to set about such a purchase;
and his mind misgives him as he remembers
what he has heard of the tricks of dealers. So he says,
“Oh, my dear, I don’t see how we can manage it. We
should be cheated, to begin with, and pay twice as much
as he is worth, and he would run away and throw you
off; and then he would be always sick, and finally fall
lame, and would have to be given away before the season
is over.” This is the critical point of this part of
the little family transaction, and if the daughter has
nothing more convincing to offer in reply than some
vague statement that she is sure she sees plenty of good
horses in the street, and that she does not see why her
horse should be sick any more than any one else’s, and
that there must be plenty of good men to take care of
him to be had at low wages, then probably her case is
lost. But suppose that she replies: “Oh yes, papa, I
<i>know</i> a horse that will do <i>nicely</i> and can’t be sickly for
he has worked all summer and not lost <i>a day</i> and he is
eight years old and so has eaten all his wild oats by
this time and he isn’t a very pretty color but then we
can buy him cheaper for that reason and I don’t care
so much for color as I do for <i>shape</i> and he is <i>very</i> well
formed indeed his legs and feet are excellent and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
has a broad shoulder and a pretty neck and head and
we gave him a long drive the other day and he never
missed <i>a step</i> and he isn’t afraid of anything and I
drove him fast up a steep hill and jumped out at the
top to give him a bunch of clover and took the opportunity
to listen to his breathing and to feel his pulse
and there is nothing the matter with <i>his</i> heart or wind
I assure you and I will promise to go to the stable once a
day to see him.” Then the chances are that, after laughing
at the long sentence without a stop, and telling her
she is a runaway filly herself, papa will say, “Well, suppose
we take a look at this wonderful animal; we are
not obliged to buy him, you know, unless we please,
and I don’t say what I may decide finally,” and her case
is won. To be able, however, to make the reply above
supposed, simple as it sounds, indicates a very unusual
amount of observation for a young girl.</p>

<p>There are many ladies who can at a glance tell real
point lace from artificial, be the imitation never so good;
but there are comparatively few who know the points
of a horse, or can detect any but the most glaring defects
or blemishes. The reason is simply want of practice,
for the difference between the well-made and the
ill-made horse, or between the sound animal and the
spavined or foundered one, is far greater than that between
the two pieces of lace above mentioned, which to
most masculine eyes would appear exactly alike. With
her superior delicacy of observation and quickness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
perception, a woman ought to be, other things supposed
equal, a better judge of horses than a man, and there
must surely be a great many who, if they really believed
this, would think it worth their while to master the
small vocabulary of technical terms in which the information
they require is always couched, and such would
speedily find their reward in the opening of a new and
interesting field of research. To begin with, how few
ladies so much as know the names of the different parts
of the animal! Head, legs, and body, eyes, ears, and
tail, are about all the words in the feminine dictionary
of horse lore, and whether the pasterns are not a disease
of colts, the coronet a part of a bridle, and the frog a
swelling in the throat, my lady knoweth not. A half-hour,
however, given to the illustration on the following
page, will remove once for all this preliminary difficulty,
and will open the way to a consideration of the
proper form and motion of the parts of which the
names are here given:</p>

rest of the joint.”</li>

<li><i>Hoof.</i>&mdash;Deep, like a cup; not flat, like a saucer.</li>

<li><i>Jaw.</i>&mdash;Should be wide up toward the socket, to give room for
windpipe, and permit of a graceful carriage of head.</li>

<li><i>Ribs.</i>&mdash;Should be well arched, and come up close to the hip.</li>

<li><i>Shoulder</i> (7, 7).&mdash;Should be long and oblique.</li>

<li><i>Spavin Place</i> (27).&mdash;Should be free from bony enlargement.</li>

<p>To be a “good judge of a horse” is indeed an accomplishment
as rare as it is desirable; but while it cannot
be taught by word of mouth or pen, yet a few principles
may be acquired which will be of great assistance
in cultivating the eye. Even if the judgment be never
so thoroughly formed as to be a safe guide unaided in
purchasing, yet a great deal of pleasure may be derived
from noting the comparative excellences of the really
fine horses constantly to be seen in this country; and
there is no reason in the world why a lady’s opinion on
this subject should continue to weigh as little as it has
generally done hitherto. A graceful neck and an air of
spirit usually win the feminine suffrages, yet often co-exist
with a long back, spindle-shanks, and a chest both
shallow and narrow. Nevertheless, a good neck is an
excellent thing, and so is a small head, especially if it
have a wide forehead; but next look to see if there is
also (to use a horsey expression), “a short back and a
long belly,” a deep chest, a sloping shoulder, and legs
broad and long above the knee and hock, but broad and
short below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arabs have a proverb that “there should be four
points of a horse long, four short, and four broad.” The
long are the neck, the forearm, the thigh, and the belly;
the short are the back, the pastern, the tail, and the ear;
the broad are the forehead, the chest, the croup, and the
limbs. The head should be small and bony; that of
an English thorough-bred of fifteen and three-quarter
hands will measure twenty-two to twenty-four inches in
length, with the forehead eight to ten inches broad, the
face dishing below the eyes. The withers should be
high, the shoulder as broad as possible&mdash;not fleshy, but
bony&mdash;and lying at an angle of about forty-five degrees.
The chest should be broad and deep, to give room for
lungs and heart. The knees should be broad, the hoofs
large, and not flat, but deep.</p>

<p>The reasons for some of the above recommendations
may be made clearer by a rough comparison between
the frame of the horse and that of man. For instance,
the shoulder of the former, from the withers to its forward
point at the joint, is equivalent to the shoulder-blade
and collar-bone of the latter, and a broad shoulder
is as sure an indication of strength in the one as in the
other. If the horse is “short above and long below,” it
gives him a carriage similar to that of a man with a
full, broad chest, who holds his head high and his shoulders
back.</p>

<p>The knee of the horse corresponds to the human
wrist, and his <i>hock</i>, or “back knee,” as the children call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
it, to our heel. The shank of the fore-leg, then, or the
part between the knee and fetlock, corresponds to the
hand, and the hoof and pastern to the fingers; while
the shank of the hind-leg, or the part between hock and
fetlock, corresponds to our foot, the hoof and pastern
being the toes. The horse may thus be said to walk
upon the tips of his fingers and toes, and it will readily
be seen why the leg weakens in proportion as the pastern
and shank lengthen. The arm proper of the horse
is very short and almost concealed from view, reaching
from the forward point of the shoulder to the elbow,
which is close against the side.</p>

<p>The more oblique the shoulder, the greater the power
of this arm to throw the forearm forward, so as to support
the body in the gallop, and in coming down from
a leap. A straight shoulder is adapted for pulling loads,
but is not fit for the saddle, except upon level roads, becoming
positively dangerous in broken ground. The
two upper members of the hind-leg, reaching from the
hip to the hock, are together commonly called the thigh,
as the thigh proper, which stretches from the hip to the
stifle-joint, is very short and almost concealed from observation.
The stifle-joint, which corresponds to our
knee, lies close against the flank. Read the description,
to some extent traditional, of the wonderful mare
Swallow, in Kingsley’s “Hereward the Wake.” She was
evidently not from Arab stock, with her big ugly head;
but horses&mdash;like men and women&mdash;of extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
strength, and beauty too, are sometimes happened upon
in the most unlikely places. Indeed, in many an ungraceful
form there is stored up an amount of vital energy
which explains the saying that one can find “good
horses of all shapes.” Nevertheless, the presumption is
always in favor of the well-shaped animal, and the acknowledged
type of equine beauty is the English thorough-bred.
This is of pure Arab blood, but so improved
by many generations of careful breeding and training
that it now excels not only all other European and Oriental
races but the modern Arab himself, that is considered
to be, weight for weight, twenty-five per cent.
stronger than other breeds. One invariable mark of
Arab blood, by-the-bye, is a high and graceful carriage of
the tail. The eye should be kind and quiet, that of an
Arab very gentle, even sleepy, when at rest, but full of
fire and animation when in motion.</p>

<p>“The relative proportions of and exact shape desirable
in each of the points described varies considerably
in the several breeds. Thus, when speed and activity
are essential, an oblique shoulder-blade is a <i>sine quâ non</i>,
while for heavy harness it can hardly be too upright.
<i>There are some elements, however, which are wanted in
any horse, such as big hocks and knees, flat legs with large
sinews, open jaws</i> (that is, with the lower jaw-bones wide
apart), <i>and full nostrils</i>.”</p>

<p>It is well, after taking a general look at a horse and
getting an impression of him as a whole, to divide him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
up mentally into sections, and examine these in detail
one after the other. Taking first the head, which should
be bony, not fleshy, remember that the more brain the
more “horse sense.” Next look at the neck, which
should be neither too thick nor too long, but connecting
head and shoulders by a graceful sweep. Then the forequarters,
observing that the shoulder-blade and true arm
are both long, well supplied though not loaded with
muscle, and join each other at the point of the shoulder
at a rather sharp angle. Then the “middle-piece,”
which should be rounded in the barrel, arched slightly
in the loin, “short above and long below,” and well
ribbed up towards the hip. Next the hind-quarters, then
the legs, knees, hocks, and feet, observing that the knees
are firm, the cannon-bones and pastern are flat and
strong, and that the back sinew is strong and stands free
from the bone.</p>

<p>Now have the horse set in motion, and observe him
first from one side, then from the other, and then from
behind, noting the carriage and movements of the different
parts in the order above given. This examination
is practically the more important of the two.</p>

<p>Let no one suppose that mere verbal instruction, however
judicious and elaborate, will, without practice, make
a good judge of horse-flesh any more than it will of Brussels
point-lace. All it is here intended to do is to aid
in training the eye, which must be constantly exercised
upon whatever specimens may come before it, compar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ing
them mentally with one another, and noting their
defects and qualities whether of form or of motion. It
will soon be found that such observations, particularly
when relating to the motions of the horse, have a fascination
peculiarly their own, and open a new and wide
field of amusement.</p>

<p>In examining a horse a lady cannot of course usually
make the thorough inspection personally which would
be necessary to warrant his limbs and wind perfectly
sound, but she can, by taking a little time to it, form
an opinion which will be very nearly correct. She
should first master the vocabulary at the end of this
chapter, which will give her an idea what defects to be
on the lookout for, and just where to seek for them;
and she should cultivate her eye at every opportunity
by scanning critically every horse she sees&mdash;or, to be
more moderate, say one or two a day&mdash;endeavoring to
detect a “spavin” or “curb,” or what not, which the
owner does not suspect or perhaps shuts his eyes to.
Then, when a horse is brought up for her approval, let
her take her own time, refuse to be hurried or humbugged,
but, as already suggested, look him over from
all sides, at rest and in motion, and finally <i>get him
on trial for a week</i>. This last precaution is the most
valuable of all, and worth, as “Stonehenge” says, ten
per cent. on the price of the animal, and it can very
often be obtained by the simple offer of paying for his
services in case he is not purchased; indeed, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the most successful New York City dealers grant this
privilege to any responsible customer as a matter of
course. To return to our inspection: First take a side
view from a little distance, observing that he stands
perpendicularly on all four legs, bearing equal weight
on each; any “pointing,” or putting forward of a fore-foot
to relieve it of its share of weight, being indicative
of tenderness if not lameness. Notice the size, shape,
and relative proportion of the different parts, and scrutinize
them carefully for swellings, or for weakened or
deformed joints. Then do the same from before, then
from behind. Now have him led past you, first at a
walk, then at a slow trot, insisting that the groom shall
not take him by the headstall, but by the end of the
halter, so as to leave him free to nod his head if he
pleases. Now have him saddled and bridled, and all
his paces shown, finishing with a smart gallop long
enough to sweat him well, after which listen carefully
to his breathing, which should be noiseless; observe
that the heaving of the flanks is regular and not spasmodic,
and that the beating of the heart is not violent
or irregular. During your week of trial take some disinterested
person with you to serve as witness in case
of accident or misconduct, and work the horse hard every
day, so as to be sure that he does not lose his appetite
when fatigued, but being careful not to injure
his feet by galloping on hard roads, or to let him slip
or strain himself in any way. Remember the oft-quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
words of the English stable-man: “It ain’t the speed
that ’urts the ’orse; it’s the ’ammer, ’ammer, ’ammer on
the ’ard ’igh-road.” After your first ride, leave the
saddle on for twenty minutes with the girths slackened,
and next morning, before putting it on again, examine
the back carefully for any soreness or puffy spot, and if
such exist, abstain from riding until it has quite disappeared,
for a day of patience now is better than a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
after a saddle-gall has become fairly established. The
saddle, of course, should fit the horse well, and there
should always be a free space along above the backbone
and withers.</p>

<p>The color of a horse is an important factor in the

special preferences, yet probably the order of the following
list will give the average taste of the horse-buying

<p class="center">[Those printed in small capitals constitute <span class="smcap">Unsoundness</span> in the eye of the law.]</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Acclimation.</i>&mdash;Horses removed from one part of the country to
another have usually a period of indisposition, often of severe illness,
and always for some time require more than ordinary care. It
is well, therefore, not to buy a Western horse in the Atlantic States
until he has been at least a month in his new surroundings.</li>

<li><i><a id="Apoplexy" name="Apoplexy"></a>Apoplexy.</i>&mdash;Sometimes called “sleepy staggers.” Begins with
drowsiness, passing into insensibility, with snoring respiration, and
ending in death.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Blindness.</span>&mdash;Often comes on gradually. Eyes of a bluish-black
are thought suspicious, as is inflammation of ball or lid, or cloudiness
of pupil.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Blind Staggers.</span>&mdash;See “<a href="#Megrims">Megrims</a>” and “<a href="#Staggers">Staggers</a>.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Bog-spavin" name="Bog-spavin"></a>Bog-spavin.</span>&mdash;A soft swelling on the inner side of the hock-joint
towards the front. It is caused by the formation of a sac contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ing
synovial fluid which has oozed out of the joint. The result
usually of brutality. Incurable.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Blood-spavin" name="Blood-spavin"></a>Blood-spavin.</span>&mdash;A swelling in nearly the same place caused by
an aneurism or sac of arterial blood. Incurable. Very rare.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Bone-spavin" name="Bone-spavin"></a>Bone-spavin.</span>&mdash;A swelling caused by a bony growth on the inside
of the hock-joint towards the front. It produces lameness,
which sometimes passes off temporarily after a few minutes’ work.
Sometimes curable. This is what is usually meant by spavin.</li>

<li><i>Bots.</i>&mdash;Caused by the larvæ of the bot-fly, which cling to the lining
of the stomach by their two hooks till after several months they
reach maturity and pass out with the droppings. They seem to do
little harm, and should be left alone, as they cannot be destroyed by
any medicine safe for a horse to take.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Breaking Down.</span>&mdash;A rupture of the tendons of the leg causing
the fetlock-joint to give way downward. Incurable.</li>

<li><i>Broken Knee.</i>&mdash;Indicated by white or bare spots, showing that the
horse has been down, and is presumably a stumbler.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Broken_Wind" name="Broken_Wind"></a>Broken Wind.</span>&mdash;Accompanied by a husky cough, and indicated
by heaving flanks and forcible double respiration after exercise.
Incurable.</li>

<li><i>Capped Hock.</i>&mdash;A soft movable swelling on point of hock, caused
by a bruise, usually got in kicking.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Cataract.</span>&mdash;Opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye.</li>

<li><i><a id="Chapped_Heels" name="Chapped_Heels"></a>Chapped Heels.</i>&mdash;Always the result of neglect. Often accompanied
by fever and constitutional disturbance.</li>

<li><i>Cold.</i>&mdash;Shown by dulness, rough coat, loss of appetite, tears and
running at the nose. Give soft food and nurse well without exercise.</li>

<li><i><a id="Colic" name="Colic"></a>Colic.</i>&mdash;Distinguished from inflammation of the bowels by intervals
of quiet between the spasms, and by the fact that the horse
will strike his belly violently in the hope of relief. Give first a
warm injection, to remove any obstruction in lower bowel, and then
administer stimulants.</li>

<li><i>Contracted Heels.</i>&mdash;Often caused by improper shoeing, but often
natural, and in this case producing no ill result.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Corns.</span>&mdash;Do not at all resemble human corns. A corn is a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>dish
and very sensitive spot in the sole of the foot under the shoe,
caused by a rupture of the delicate blood-vessels, resulting in an
abnormal fungoid growth.</li>

<li><i>Costiveness.</i>&mdash;May bring on “blind staggers” in a horse inclined
to this disease. No horse should be hurried when first taken out
till his bowels have been moved.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Cough.</span>&mdash;Constitutes unsoundness while it lasts. Caused by foul
air, dusty food, irregular work. Crush the oats, damp the hay, and
give linseed tea for drink.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Cribbing</span>, <i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Crib-biting</span>.&mdash;Is sometimes considered a vice, but
is doubtless a result of indigestion. The horse lays hold of the
manger with his teeth, straightens his neck, sucks wind into his
stomach, and ejects gas. Probably some alkali, say lime-water or
baking soda, would be beneficial.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Curb.</span>&mdash;A soft, painful swelling on the back of the hind-leg six
or eight inches below the hock. See <a href="#Illus_41">illustration</a>.</li>

<li><i>Cutting.</i>&mdash;See “<a href="#Interfering">Interfering</a>” and “<a href="#Speedy_Cut">Speedy Cut</a>.”</li>

<li><i>Discharge from Nostril.</i>&mdash;Is usually caused by a simple cold, but
may be a symptom of the contagious and incurable disease <span class="small"><a href="#Glanders">GLANDERS</a></span>,
and proximity to it should therefore be carefully avoided.</li>

<li><i>Distemper.</i>&mdash;A disease of young horses, occurring once only. See
“<a href="#Strangles">Strangles</a>.”</li>

<li><i>Ewe Neck.</i>&mdash;Carries the head high and nearly in a horizontal position,
so that the bit has not a proper bearing on the “bars,” but is
inclined to slip back towards the grinders.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Farcy" name="Farcy"></a>Farcy.</span>&mdash;An incurable and contagious disease, caused by blood-poisoning,
and indicated by sores usually on inside of thigh, or on
neck and hips. As it is communicable to human beings, every
farcied horse should be immediately killed. It is well to avoid all
approach to horses having sores of any kind. See “<a href="#Glanders">Glanders</a>.”</li>

<li><i>Filled Legs.</i>&mdash;A swelled condition of the lower parts, usually caused
by want of exercise, and relieved by bandaging and rubbing.</li>

<li><i>Fistula of the Withers.</i>&mdash;An abscess among the muscles over the
shoulder-blades, usually caused by pressure of saddle upon the bony
ridge of back. Requires surgical operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></li>

<li><i>Forging.</i>&mdash;See “<a href="#Overreaching">Overreaching</a>.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Founder" name="Founder"></a>Founder, or Fever in the Feet.</span>&mdash;An inflammation of the
parts between the crust of the foot and the pedal-bone, including
the <i>laminæ</i>, which cease to secrete horn. It is caused sometimes by
hard roads, and sometimes by eating or drinking or standing in a
draught of air when heated. This name is commonly applied to
any rheumatic lameness of the fore-feet or legs brought on as
above, whether its seat be the feet, the tendons of the legs, or the
muscles of the breast, in which last case it is called “chest-founder.”
The treatment, which is only palliative, is hot bathing and friction
with liniments.</li>

<li><i>Gadfly Bites.</i>&mdash;Often very annoying. May be prevented by washing
legs and flanks with a strong tea of green elder bark.</li>

<li><i>Galls</i>&mdash;from saddle.&mdash;Best prevented by leaving the saddle in
place for twenty minutes after loosening the girths. When occurring,
however, should receive prompt attention, as they are very
tedious if neglected. Examine the back carefully after the first
ride on a new horse, and also before putting on the saddle the next
day.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Glanders" name="Glanders"></a>Glanders.</span>&mdash;A disgusting, contagious, and incurable disease, the
chief symptom of which is a discharge from one nostril, at first
transparent, then slightly sticky, then thick and yellow. As it is
highly contagious to human beings, in whom it is equally dreadful
and always fatal, <i>a glandered horse should be instantly killed, as the
law requires</i>. It is well to avoid all horses having any discharge,
however slight, from the nose. Glanders may be caught from
“<a href="#Farcy">farcy</a>,” and <i>vice versa</i>.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Grapes.</span>&mdash;A filthy and incurable disease of heels and pastern,
caused by gross neglect. It is the last stage of “grease.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Grease.</span>&mdash;An aggravated form of “chapped heels,” accompanied
by swelling, fever and a serous discharge. Wash clean frequently,
and anoint with Dalley’s salve.</li>

<li><i>Gripes.</i>&mdash;See “<a href="#Colic">Colic</a>.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Heart Disease.</span>&mdash;May be detected by auscultation. Incurable.
Ends in sudden death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></li>

<li><span class="smcap">Heaves.</span>&mdash;See “<a href="#Broken_Wind">Broken Wind</a>.”</li>

<li><i>Hide-bound.</i>&mdash;The skin appears too tight, and as if fast to the
ribs. It is caused by a disordered stomach, and requires nourishing
food.</li>

<li><i>Inflammation of Bowels.</i>&mdash;The pain is continuous, and the horse is
careful not actually to strike his belly with his feet. Requires, of
course, very different treatment from colic, but an injection should
be the first thing done.</li>

<li><i><a id="Interfering" name="Interfering"></a>Interfering.</i>&mdash;Striking the fetlock-joint with the foot. Caused
sometimes by weakness and fatigue, but usually by bad shoeing,
and a good blacksmith is the best adviser.</li>

<li><i>Lampas.</i>&mdash;A swelling of the gums, relieved by lancing.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Knee-sprung.</span>&mdash;Incurable. Result of overwork.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Knuckled.</span>&mdash;Same as “set over.” A condition of the fetlock-joint
corresponding to that of the “sprung” knee.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Laminitis" name="Laminitis"></a>Laminitis.</span>&mdash;The scientific name of “<a href="#Founder">founder</a>.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Mad Staggers.</span>&mdash;Violent insanity, caused by inflammation of the
brain. The last stage sometimes of sleepy staggers. Incurable.</li>

<li><i>Mallenders.</i>&mdash;A scurvy patch at the back of the knee, caused by
neglect, and not obstinate.</li>

<li><i>Mange.</i>&mdash;An itch produced by a parasitic insect.</li>

<li><span class="smcap"><a id="Megrims" name="Megrims"></a>Megrims.</span>&mdash;A falling-sickness like epilepsy. It begins with a laying
back of the ears and shaking of the head; is accompanied by convulsions;
and passes off of itself in two or three minutes, the horse
appearing to be none the worse. Often called “Blind Staggers.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Navicular Disease.</span>&mdash;An ulceration of the navicular-joint in
the foot, causing lameness; incurable, except by extirpation of the
nerve.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Nerved.</span>&mdash;A nerved horse has had one of the nerves of the foot
cut to remove the pain and lameness caused by the “navicular
disease.”</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Ophthalmia.</span>&mdash;A purulent inflammation of the eye. Epidemic.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Organic Disease</span> of the bony system anywhere constitutes unsoundness.</li>

<li><i><a id="Overreaching" name="Overreaching"></a>Overreaching.</i>&mdash;Striking the toe of the front-foot with the toe of the
hind-foot; sometimes called “clicking.” Often remedied by shoeing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></li>

<li><i>Poll-evil.</i>&mdash;An abscess in the top of the neck, near the head, caused
by a blow.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Pumice Foot.</span>&mdash;Bulging sole, weak crust, the result of “<a href="#Laminitis">laminitis</a>.”
Incurable.</li>

<li><i>Quarter Crack.</i>&mdash;Occurs usually on the inside of fore-foot. A bad
sign, as well as very slow and troublesome to cure.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Quidding.</span>&mdash;Dropping the food half chewed from the mouth.
Indicative of sore throat.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Quittor.</span>&mdash;Burrowing abscess in the foot.</li>

<li><i>Rheumatism.</i>&mdash;Cause, effect, and treatment the same as for human
beings.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Ring-bone.</span>&mdash;An enlargement of the bone by growth, a little
above the coronet.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Roaring.</span>&mdash;Caused by a contraction of windpipe. Incurable.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Ruptures</span> of all kinds constitute unsoundness.</li>

<li><i>Saddle-gall.</i>&mdash;Swelling caused by chafing of saddle. If the skin
is broken it is called a “sitfast;” if not, a “warble.”</li>

<li><i>Sallenders.</i>&mdash;Scurvy patch in front of hock-joint.</li>

<li><i>Sand Crack.</i>&mdash;Occurs on the inside of fore-foot and on the toe of
the hind-foot.</li>

<li><i>Scratches.</i>&mdash;See “<a href="#Chapped_Heels">Chapped Heels</a>.”</li>

<li><i>Scouring.</i>&mdash;Looseness of the bowels.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Seedy Toe.</span>&mdash;A separation of the crust of the hoof from the laminæ,
the result of <a href="#Laminitis">laminitis</a>. Scarcely curable.</li>

<li><span class="smcap">Side-bone.</span>&mdash;A bony growth just above the coronet, causing
lameness. Incurable.</li>
